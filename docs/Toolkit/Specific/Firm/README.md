## EBIT

 > ...

## EBITDA

> **Note**: **EBIT** Helps to measure 'operating effiency'; How much money do I Make; without taking into account capital; depre-ciation; and; taxes and other inputs; this; plus Depreciation and Amortization is `EBITDA (EBIT + DA)`.

> **Goal**: **Capture** a company’s core operating performance by excluding the effects of financing (interest), taxation, and non-cash accounting items such as depreciation and amortization.

### 🔍 **Breakdown of the Term**

- **Earnings** = Net income (profit)
- **Before Interest** = Excludes the cost of debt
- **Before Taxes** = Excludes tax obligations
- **Before Depreciation & Amortization** = Excludes non-cash expenses related to asset write-downs

### 📊 **Formula**

There are two common ways to calculate EBITDA:

```text
Net Income = Operating Profit - Interest - Taxes - Depreciation - Amortization
```

**1. From net income:**

```text
EBITDA = Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization

=> 

EBITDA = Operating Profit (before any of those deductions)
```

**2. From operating income:**

```
EBITDA = Operating Income (EBIT) + Depreciation + Amortization
```

### ✅ **Why It's Used**

* **Removes distortions** from financing (interest), taxes, and accounting methods (depreciation & amortization)
* **Compares operational performance** between companies regardless of capital structure or tax environment
* Common in **valuation**, especially for **private equity, venture capital, and M\&A** activity

### ⚠️ **Limitations**

* Can **overstate profitability** since it excludes actual costs (like asset depreciation)
* Not a GAAP metric—can be **manipulated** by companies in reporting
* Doesn’t reflect cash flow or changes in working capital

## Gross Margin

> Gross Margin tells you how much profit you keep per dollar of sales.

**Gross Margin** is a profitability metric that shows the percentage of revenue remaining after subtracting the **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**. It reflects how efficiently a company produces its goods or services relative to its revenue.

### **Formula:**

$$
\text{Gross Margin} = \left( \frac{\text{Revenue} - \text{COGS}}{\text{Revenue}} \right) \times 100
$$

### **Interpretation:**

* A higher gross margin indicates a company retains more money on each dollar of sales to cover other costs and profit.
* It's often used to compare companies in the same industry or to track performance over time.

### **Example:**

If a company has:

* Revenue = \$1,000,000
* COGS = \$600,000

Then:

$$
\text{Gross Margin} = \left( \frac{1,000,000 - 600,000}{1,000,000} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
$$

This means 40% of the revenue remains after covering direct production costs.
