> A **Strategy** serves as the **Operating System (OS)** of an organization, explaining its behavior and enabling it to make decisions in a purposeful and structured manner. It guides the organization's overall behavior and provides a framework for achieving its goals.

> **Complexity theorists** define strategy as the unfolding of the internal and external aspects of the organization that results in actions in a **socio-economic** context.

> A strategy can be viewed as a **meta-dynamics**, a higher-level force that governs and shapes the underlying dynamics of a system. It sets the framework within which various behaviors, decisions, and interactions unfold, directing the flow of actions and reactions to achieve long-term objectives.

> [**A Strategist**] Developing a strategy requires a deep understanding of the system, its objectives, and the environment in which it operates. The process of crafting a strategy, typically undertaken by a **'strategist,'** is inherently shaped by the specific context, domain, and system involved. As a result, a **strategist** is typically effective only within **narrowly** **defined** domains, environments, and objectives.
> 

> To formulate a **strategy**, a **strategist** must deeply understand the system they aim to govern. This understanding is possible only through a **feedback loop** of doing and learning, which provides insights gained from working within the system. The strategist must also possess concrete, domain-specific knowledge of the system to create effective strategies. A contact-based follow-up with the system **shaped** by the strategy must be made to enable improvements, corrections, and learning.

> A very large system is often compose of subsystem; so many strategies can be underpinign the dynamics of an organization at the same time.

## Characterization

> A **strategy** is the governing framework of a system, designed to achieve a set of expected outcomes. In this note, we aim to present a 'template' for how the dynamics of a system can change through a shift in the underlying governing framework (strategy).
> 

### **Context of the Strategy**

- **System**:
    - **System Characterization**: Define the system in which the strategy operates (e.g., organization, market, ecosystem, or process).
    - **Power Distribution**: Identify how decision-making authority and influence are distributed across the system (e.g., leadership, teams, external stakeholders).
    - **Divisions & Subsystems**: Breakdown of components, departments, or subunits within the system.
    - **Interactions & Relationships**: Define how parts of the system interact with each other, both internally (within the organization) and externally (with competitors, customers, partners).
    - **Agents**: Identify the key actors or stakeholders who influence or are influenced by the strategy (e.g., employees, management, customers, suppliers).
- **Risks**: Identify potential risks or uncertainties that could affect the strategy’s success. Consider both internal and external factors.
- **Resources**: List the resources needed to implement the strategy, such as financial, human, technological, and operational assets.
- **Time Frame**: Define the time horizon for the strategy (e.g., short-term, medium-term, long-term). Consider milestones and deadlines.
- **Environment**: Describe the external conditions that influence the strategy, including market trends, economic conditions, technology advancements, regulatory factors, and competitors.
- **Stakeholders**: Identify the key internal and external stakeholders whose interests are affected by the strategy. Consider their roles, needs, and expectations.
- **Feedback Loops & Interactions**: Describe the mechanisms that allow the strategy to evolve based on ongoing feedback. How will feedback from the system or stakeholders be integrated to adapt the strategy?

### **Current Dynamics and State**

- **Old Dynamics**: Describe the existing behavior or system dynamics prior to the strategy implementation. What are the challenges, strengths, weaknesses, or current trends in the system?
- **Old Behavior**: Explain how the system behaves in its current state—this could include patterns, routines, or habitual actions that drive current performance.
- **Current State**: Define the present position of the system. What is the system’s status in terms of goals, performance, and overall functionality?
- **Movement Trajectory**: Outline the system’s current path or evolution. Is it improving, stagnating, or declining? What trends or behaviors are influencing this trajectory?

### **Desired Dynamics and Desired Future State**

- **New Dynamics**: Define the new behavior or dynamics you aim to create within the system. What changes will occur in terms of performance, operations, or interactions?
- **Desired State**: Describe the end goal or state that the strategy seeks to achieve. What is the optimal outcome the strategy is driving towards (e.g., growth, market leadership, innovation, customer satisfaction)?
- **Movement Trajectory (Towards Desired State)**: Define the expected path or transformation toward the desired state. What milestones or stages will be achieved along the way?
