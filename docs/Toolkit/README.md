# Research Toolkit

> The **Research Toolkit** defines the core components that structure, operationalize, and communicate research within each domain. It provides a common architecture to ensure conceptual coherence, methodological rigor, and public value.

## Dimension(s)

| **Component**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ontology**               | Establishes the conceptual and categorical foundation of the domain — its key entities, relationships, and levels of organization. Clarifies what constitutes valid objects of study and how they interact.       |
| **Method(s)**              | Specifies the analytical, computational, and empirical approaches used to investigate the domain. Includes model-building strategies, inference techniques, and validation procedures.                            |
| **Data Sources**           | Lists the primary and secondary data repositories underpinning research, such as surveys, administrative records, firm-level data, trade databases, or open scientific datasets.                                  |
| **Research Output**        | Defines the expected deliverables and artifacts — such as reports, models, datasets, visualization tools, policy briefs, or publications — that emerge from the research process.                                 |
| **Quality Control**        | Describes the mechanisms ensuring methodological rigor, data validity, and reproducibility. Includes peer review, replication protocols, code audits, and version-controlled research pipelines.                  |
| **Communication Strategy** | Outlines how findings are synthesized, translated, and disseminated to different audiences. Includes knowledge visualization, open data practices, stakeholder engagement, and integration into public discourse. |
