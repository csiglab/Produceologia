# Reflection

> The Reflection space ensures that inquiry and action remain adaptive, self-aware, and purpose-driven. It invites continuous questioning of whether the research agenda, organizational choices, and collaborative practices remain aligned with the overarching vision and evolving context.

Key Questions:

* How can we act more effectively on our vision?
* How can we evolve our vision as we learn and grow?
