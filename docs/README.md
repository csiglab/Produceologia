# Guide

> Welcome to **Laboratorium Productivum et Mercatorum (Produciologia)**: a space to study the economy in depth—its technologies, production systems, markets, and people—with the goal of designing systems of production, distribution, and exchange that enhance human well-being while ensuring long-term economic sustainability.

## Research Domain

> Understanding the spheres of production and exchange.

* **Product Space** – Goods, manufacturing processes, innovation, and supply chains.
* **Service Space** – Design and delivery of services, labor dynamics, and value creation.
* **Technology Space** – Tools, processes, and innovations that drive productivity and industrial evolution.
* **Production Organization (Organizing Economic Activity)** – How societies apply technology, expertise, and technical resources to produce and deliver goods and services, encompassing individual firms, networks of firms, and other economic agents.
* **Social Technology**  – Institutions, networks, organizational frameworks, and human capital that underpin economic activity.
* **Foundations** – Core systems that sustain production: energy, natural resources, and ecological constraints.

## Praxis

> Designing new social structures that support and enhance production systems.

* Integrating institutional, technological, and human factors to optimize production and exchange.
* **Developing** governance frameworks, cooperative structures, and networks that promote efficiency, resilience, and equity.
* **Translating research** insights into actionable isnights  in the domain of  business strategies and organizational models.
