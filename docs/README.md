# Guide

> Welcome to **Laboratorium Productivum et Mercatorum (Produciologia)** — a research space dedicated to the in-depth study of the economy: its technologies, productive systems, markets, and human actors.

> Its mission is to **design and analyze systems of production, distribution, and exchange** that enhance human well-being, strengthen productive capabilities, and ensure the long-term sustainability of economic life.

## Research Domain

> Systematic study and design of how societies **produce, exchange, generate technology, and evolve their productive structures**, integrating material, technological and  organizational dimensions.

| **Product Space**           | Examines *what is produced* and *how productive capabilities evolve* across goods, processes, and value chains.                   | • How do sectors and firms upgrade or diversify production?<br>• What patterns of specialization or dependence emerge in the product space?<br>• How can production networks be restructured for higher value creation?                   |
| **Service Space**           | Studies the design, delivery, and organization of services as key sources of value creation and employment.                       | • How are services organized and delivered efficiently?<br>• What role do labor, knowledge, and digitalization play in productivity growth?<br>• How do service sectors interact with manufacturing and technology?                       |
| **Technology Space**        | Investigates the tools, processes, and innovations that enable productivity, transformation, and industrial evolution.            | • How do technologies diffuse and shape production frontiers?<br>• What are the local capabilities and dependencies in critical technologies?<br>• How can technological ecosystems be strengthened and governed effectively?             |
| **Production Organization** | Analyzes how societies coordinate economic activity — through firms, institutions, and networks — to transform inputs into value. | • How are firms and production networks structured and governed?<br>• What organizational and institutional designs foster innovation and cooperation?<br>• How do human capital and social technologies shape productive efficiency?     |
| **Foundations**             | Explores the material, energetic, and ecological bases that sustain production and constrain economic evolution.                  | • How do energy systems, resources, and infrastructure enable or limit production?<br>• How can ecological sustainability be integrated into productive systems?<br>• What are the trade-offs between growth, efficiency, and resilience? |
| **Finance Space**           | Studies the systems that mobilize, allocate, and govern capital for productive and technological transformation.                  | • How do financial structures shape industrial and technological trajectories?<br>• What mechanisms channel savings into productive investment?<br>• How can financial architectures support innovation and long-term development?        |
| **Organizational Design**   | Studies the internal architecture, coordination, and reflexive systems of firms and institutions.                                 | • How can organizations be designed to balance efficiency, adaptability, and innovation?<br>• What design principles foster learning, coordination, and viability?<br>• How does design interact with workflow, culture, and strategy?    |
