## Terminology

> Note: Technical objects are constructed from combinations of other technical objects and the operational techniques that underpin them.

> Note: A Product is also a Technical Object—one that aggregates multiple technical objects and operational techniques into a deployable, externally oriented system. However, in this document we will use the term Product specifically to refer to the final user–facing object.

> Note: There are other types of techniques for specialized industries. In computing, **Representational Techniques** are particularly important, as they define how information, processes, or states are encoded, modeled, or depicted for processing, storage, and communication.

> Note: Technical Objects can be components or objects used in the production process.

> Which kinds of specialized techniques does this field use?

| **Foundational Research**      | Research aimed at generating new scientific knowledge, theories, or principles without immediate practical application, forming the basis for future technical innovation. | ...                                                                                    |
| **Technical Research**         | Research focused on transforming foundational knowledge into new technical objects, operational techniques, or methods that can be applied in systems and products.        | ...                                                                           |
| **Operational Technique**      | A repeatable, competence-based procedure used to achieve a specific operational effect under constraints.                                                                  | ...                                                                                     |
| **Technical Object**           | A structural artifact that embodies operational techniques into a stable, reproducible system with defined interfaces and invariants.                                      | ...                                                                                                   |
| **Constitutive Technique**     | The generative architectural logic that defines how a technical object is constructed, organized, and made operational as a class of objects.                              | ...  |
| **Product(s)**                 | The realized, packaged, deployable system—enabled by operational techniques and technical objects—that exposes a coherent set of capabilities to users and environments.   | ...                                                                                                                                |
