# A Guide to Investment in Shared Property

> This guide explores strategies for investing in property that is shared among multiple stakeholders, such as family members or co-owners, particularly in cases where revenues are small and may not allow immediate redistribution.

Key Questions:

- What type of scheme enables investment in a property that is shared?
- How to invest when revenues are small and do not allow redistribution?

## Scheme Space

| Investment Scheme                     | Description                                                                                                                  | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Investment with Usufruct Recovery** | Investor recovers the invested amount plus a period of free usufruct (use of the property) instead of immediate cash return. | Useful when the property produces little or irregular revenue.     |
| **Revenue-Sharing Agreement**         | Investor receives a portion of property-generated income (e.g., rent, crops) until investment is recovered.                  | Works for properties with modest but steady cash flows.            |
| **Equity Partnership**                | Investor becomes a co-owner, sharing profits and decisions proportionally.                                                   | Best for long-term investments with potential appreciation.        |
| **Deferred Return Investment**        | Returns are delayed until property is sold or produces sufficient revenue.                                                   | Helps when immediate cash flow is insufficient.                    |
| **Lease-to-Invest**                   | Investor funds improvements and receives rental income or lease payments as repayment.                                       | Aligns incentives for property maintenance and revenue generation. |

## Revenue Management Scheme

> How should revenue be managed once the investment agreement is completed?

- **Reinvestment**: Revenue is used to improve the property, increase productivity, or fund further investments. This approach prioritizes long-term growth over immediate cash returns and is useful when the property has untapped potential or requires maintenance.

- **Distribution**: Revenue is divided among stakeholders according to pre-agreed terms, such as ownership share or investment proportion. This approach provides immediate returns to investors but may limit resources for property improvements.
