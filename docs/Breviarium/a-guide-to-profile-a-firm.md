# A Guide to Profile a Firm

> In this template to profiel a firm we introduce tools to create the microeconomic model for the firm; the instittuional model and the capabilties model.

## Industry Profile

- Production Chain: Key steps in the firm’s production or service delivery process.
- Value Chain: How the firm creates value at each stage.
- Competitors: Major competitors and positioning.
- Environment: Regulatory, technological, economic, and social context affecting the firm.

## Market Profile

- Market Size: Total addressable market, served market, growth trends.
- Customer Segments: Key customer groups and their characteristics.
- Geographical Reach: Regions or countries of operation.
- Market Trends: Emerging trends affecting demand or competition.

## Production (Value Creation)

Guiding Questions:

- What does the firm produce?
- What is the firm’s production function?
- What is the firm’s technical profile?
- How does the firm perform operationally?
- What is the cost structure?
- How do structural factors shape the firm’s future performance?     Evaluate expected impacts of:
  - Learning-by-doing
  - Economies of scale
  - Economies of scope
  - Technological change
  - Environmental and regulatory factors
  - Resource constraints and external shocks

### Technical Profile

- **Category**: Constitutive Technique, Operative Technique, Production Technical Object (Capital Good), Constitutive Technical Object.
- **Use**: How the technical element is used to bring the final good into existence.

| **Category**                                   | **Element** | **Description**                                                                                          | **Use**                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Constitutive Technique**                     | —           | Fundamental principles, rules, and abstract procedures that define how the technical object is possible. | Establishes the operational logic and constraints of the final good.                      |
| **Operative Technique**                        | —           | Concrete methods, steps, and processes used to operate, manipulate, or transform elements.               | Enables the execution and functioning of the technical object during production or use.   |
| **Production Technical Object (Capital Good)** | —           | Tools, machines, instruments, or systems used in the production of the final good.                       | Provides the physical or digital means through which production takes place.              |
| **Constitutive Technical Object**              | —           | Component or subsystem essential to the identity and function of the final good.                         | Forms part of the internal architecture of the final good and allows it to exist as such. |

## Business Model (Value Capture)

Guiding Quiestions:

### Revenue Architecture

- What are the firm’s **revenue streams**, and how are they decomposed (product-level, segment-level, geography-level)?
- What is the **pricing architecture** (fixed, dynamic, discriminatory, subscription, usage-based, two-part tariff, bundling, peak-load)?
- What is the **elasticity structure** for each product and segment?
- What is the **volume model** (installed base, throughput, utilization, recurring vs. transactional share)?
- What contractual mechanisms govern cashflows (payment terms, AR cycle, lock-in mechanisms, switching costs)?

### Unit Economics & Margins

- What is the contribution margin **per product**, **per customer segment**, and **per delivery channel**?
- How does cost behavior decompose into **fixed**, **variable**, **step-fixed**, and **quasi-fixed** components?
- What is the **marginal cost curve**, and how does it scale with output?
- Does the firm have **positive learning curves** that structurally reduce marginal costs?
- How sensitive are margins to: input prices, labor costs, utilization, downtime, and demand variability?

### Cost Structure & Operating Leverage

- What is the firm’s **operating leverage** and its volatility across the business cycle?
- What are the **break-even points** for:
  - Product lines
  - Facilities
  - Channels
  - Entire firm
- How robust is the break-even structure to shocks (input shocks, demand contraction, regulatory changes)?
- Are cost centers optimized or overburdened (bottlenecks, inefficiencies, capacity slack)?

### Capital Structure Interaction

- How do financing mechanisms (debt ratios, covenant structures, working-capital cycles) influence value capture?
- How sensitive is free cash flow to cost of capital, refinancing needs, and investment cycles?
- What share of value capture is absorbed by capital providers vs. captured through operations?

### Market Power & Competitive Position

- Does the firm capture value through **price-setting power**, **cost leadership**, **differentiation**, or **network effects**?
- What is the **markup structure** relative to marginal cost?
- What is the firm’s **bargaining position** relative to suppliers and buyers (Porter power asymmetry analysis)?
- Are there **barriers to entry** or **economies of scale/scope** reinforcing value capture?

### Contractual, Platform, and Data-Based Capture

- Does the firm generate value through **platform fees**, **take rates**, or **intermediation spreads**?
- Are there **data-driven monetization loops** (ads, optimization, insights, behavioral prediction)?
- Are switching costs, lock-in, or ecosystem interdependencies sources of durable extraction?

### Risk Structure & Value Retention

- What risks systematically erode value capture (churn, volatility, operational downtime, commodity exposure)?
- How does the firm **retain value** under uncertainty (hedging, contracts, dynamic pricing, redundancy)?
- What is the **variance decomposition** of cashflow sources (stable vs. volatile components)?

## Miscellaneous

Resource Allocation (Internal Economics):

- Capital allocation
- Labor allocation
- Investment decisions
- Coordination mechanisms (hierarchy, markets, hybrid)

Incentives & Governance (Organizational Economics):

- Contracts, incentives
- Agency relationships
- Monitoring and information asymmetries
- Ownership structure

Dynamics & Growth (Evolutionary Economics)

- Capability development
- Innovation routines
- Learning curves
- Adaptation, diversification, path dependence
