# A Guide to Profile an Industry

> **Industry**: A set of firms producing similar goods or services using similar technologies or processes.
> **Market**: A social and institutional mechanism for exchange between buyers and sellers of a given good or service.

## Meta (Fundamental Understanding)

* How to model an industry? How to evaluate such model?
* What is the fundamental essence of the product or service? What problem or need does it address?
* Could the problem the product addresses disappear in the future? How might technology, regulation, or user behavior affect its relevance?
* Are there emerging substitutes, alternative solutions, or disruptive innovations that could reshape the market?
* How do social, environmental, or cultural trends influence the demand for the product?

## Production Chain & Operations

* What are the main stages from raw materials to the final product?
* How do different stages connect and depend on each other?
* Which stages are most standardized versus most specialized?
* How modular (distributed) or integrated (monolithic/concentrated) is the production structure?
* Are there bottlenecks, critical inputs, or rare resources affecting production?
* Which processes or stages are most sensitive to shocks or supply disruptions?
* Quantitative: What is the proportion of total value added at each stage of production?

## Technology & Processes

* What technologies, methods, or techniques are used at each stage of the production chain?
* How do these technologies evolve or interact across the chain?
* Which innovations could reduce costs, improve efficiency, or disrupt the chain?
* Are there technological dependencies or single points of failure?
* Quantitative: What is the technology adoption rate across the industry?

## Market Structure & Dynamics

* Who are the buyers and sellers at each stage?
* How concentrated or fragmented is the market (e.g., HHI index, top competitors’ market share)?
* How is pricing determined: cost-based, value-based, or market-driven?
* What are the key distribution channels, switching costs, and network effects?
* How do regulatory, policy, or trade factors influence competition?
* What is the industry’s sensitivity to macroeconomic or geopolitical changes?
* Firm Dynamics

## Firm Dynamics

* What is the typical firm size distribution (large vs. medium vs. small players)?
* How do firms differentiate themselves (technology, branding, service, cost leadership)?
* What are the barriers to entry and exit, including capital requirements, know-how, or regulatory hurdles?
* What is the rate of innovation and adoption of new technologies among firms?
* How do firms engage in strategic alliances, mergers, or partnerships?
* What is the profitability profile (margins, cost structure, capital intensity)?
* How dynamic is the competitive landscape (market leaders, challengers, disruptors)?
* What are the typical growth strategies (organic growth, diversification, internationalization)?

## Value Capture & Profitability

* Where in the production chain is most value generated or captured?
* Which activities contribute most to profit, differentiation, or strategic advantage?
* How could value capture shift due to technology, market, or regulatory changes?
* Are there brand effects, network effects, or scale advantages that concentrate value?
* Quantitative: Profit margins per stage, revenue share of top firms, ROI on key processes.

## Innovation & R&D

* Which stages of the production chain are most R&D-intensive? How much of total revenue is allocated to R&D?
* Is innovation primarily:

  * Incremental (process/product improvement)
  * Radical (new products or paradigms)
  * Architectural (reconfiguring production or business models)
* How is patent activity distributed across firms and stages? Are patents concentrated or dispersed?
* How quickly do innovations diffuse across the industry? What barriers exist to adoption?
* How do firms engage in open innovation, partnerships, or consortia? What roles do universities, startups, or suppliers play?
* What is the typical cycle time from idea generation to market adoption, and how does it affect competitive advantage?
* How does innovation influence pricing, differentiation, and network effects?

## Risks & Vulnerabilities

* Which inputs, suppliers, or processes represent critical vulnerabilities?
* How resilient is the industry to shocks in supply, demand, or regulation?
* Are there single points of failure in technology, logistics, or human capital?
* What are the legal, environmental, or social risks affecting production or market operations?
* Quantitative: Likelihood and potential impact of disruptions on revenue or production.

## External Forces

* How do macroeconomic trends (GDP growth, inflation, interest rates) affect the industry?
* How do geopolitical factors (trade policy, sanctions, regional conflicts) impact operations and competitiveness?
* What environmental, sustainability, or social pressures influence production, consumption, or regulation?
* How do cultural or demographic trends shape demand or product adoption?
