# An Essay on Enterprise Research Labs

> Centers dedicated to advancing knowledge, technology, and innovation within firms and across industries.

## Typology

> What types of work are conducted in such centers?

> Corporate R&D Spectrum: The Corporate R&D Spectrum maps the range of activities a company undertakes—from operational adaptation and incremental development to fundamental and transformative research—highlighting how each type of center or lab contributes to innovation, strategic advantage, and long-term technological capability. It shows which activities are market-near vs. market-distant, low-risk vs. high-risk, and short-term vs. long-term in their impact and uncertainty.
