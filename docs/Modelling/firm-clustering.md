# Firm Classfication

> Firm Classification is the systematic process of assigning firms to one or more categories within a structured taxonomy—such as industry, sector, subsector, or strategic group—based on shared characteristics including, but not limited to, their primary revenue source, input-output relationships, production technologies, customer base, or strategic behavior.

> This classification can be defined according to standardized schemas (e.g., NAICS, GICS, SIC), data-driven clustering algorithms, or economic modeling frameworks aimed at delineating market boundaries, analyzing competitive dynamics, or facilitating comparative performance evaluation across organizational types.

Key Questions:

- To which market or industry does this firm belong?
- What other firms belong to the same market or industry?
