# Technical Analysis (TA)

> **Technical Analysis (TA)** is a trading methodology used to evaluate securities (stocks, forex, cryptocurrencies, commodities, etc.) by analyzing historical price data, trading volume, and market trends. Unlike **fundamental analysis** (which examines financial statements, earnings, and economic factors), TA focuses solely on price movements and chart patterns to predict future market behavior.

## Core Beliefs of Technical Analysis

1. **Price Discounts Everything** – All known information (news, fundamentals, market sentiment) is already reflected in the asset's price.  
2. **Price Moves in Trends** – Markets tend to move in **uptrends (bullish)**, **downtrends (bearish)**, or **sideways (ranging)**.  
3. **History Repeats Itself** – Human psychology leads to recurring price patterns over time.
