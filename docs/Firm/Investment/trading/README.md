# Trading

> Trading vs Investment: Trading exploits short-term price volatility through technical catalysts (liquidity, momentum, order flow), while investing hinges on long-term intrinsic value realization via fundamental drivers (cash flows, competitive advantages, discount rates).

> Trading arbitrages mispricings in market microstructure (bid-ask spreads, gamma squeezes), whereas investing exploits mispricings in business valuation (DCF gaps, margin expansion).
