# Private Equity

> Investors invest in private companies to acquire a significant ownership stake, often involving active management to improve performance.

> Private Equity (PE) refers to a class of alternative investment vehicles that allocate capital in the private markets—outside publicly traded securities—with the objective of generating asymmetric, risk-adjusted returns through active ownership, financial engineering, and operational intervention.

PE typically encompasses:

- Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)
- Growth Equity
- Venture Capital (early stage)
- Distressed/Turnaround Investments
- Mezzanine Financing

## Share

> A share in a private company represents a unit of ownership interest in that company, entitling the holder to rights (such as economic benefits and governance participation) defined by corporate law and contractual agreements. Unlike public company shares, which are freely traded on stock exchanges, private company shares are not publicly listed and are typically subject to transfer restrictions.
