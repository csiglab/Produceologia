### 🔍 Why Insurance Is Everywhere:

1. **Uncertainty is everywhere.**
   Whether it's health, weather, legal liability, supply chain, or geopolitical risk — any uncertainty that can be modeled probabilistically can be insured.

2. **Risk is capital-intensive.**
   Many activities — like shipping oil, launching satellites, constructing buildings, or lending money — involve huge financial stakes. Insurance provides a buffer.

3. **Regulatory and contractual requirements.**
   Many sectors **require insurance by law** or for compliance — e.g., car insurance, workers' comp, or professional liability.

4. **Globalization and complexity.**
   Modern supply chains, digitization, and international trade have increased the need for niche and multi-layered insurance coverage.
