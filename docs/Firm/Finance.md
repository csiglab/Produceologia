# Firm Finance

> **Capital Structure**: **Capital financial structure** refers to the specific composition and proportional weighting of a firm’s permanent financing sources—principally equity (common and preferred stock), long-term and short-term debt (including bonds, loans, and convertible instruments), and hybrid securities—optimized under constraints such as tax shields, bankruptcy costs, agency conflicts, and market conditions, to minimize the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and maximize firm value.
