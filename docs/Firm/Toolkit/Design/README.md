# Organizational Design

> The systematic process of architecting a **firm’s internal structure**, coordination mechanisms, and reflexive capacities to achieve coherence, adaptability, and sustained performance.

## Key Questions

Foundations of Design:

* How can a firm be **designed as an integrated socio-technical system**, harmonizing people, technology, and purpose?
* What are the **core design variables** (structure, process, culture, control, incentives) that define organizational form?
* How can we distinguish between **designed structure** and **emergent structure** within a living organization?

Design Methodologies

* Which **models, methods, and analytical frameworks** can systematically guide the design of a firm?
* How can **simulation, prototyping, and system dynamics** support organizational experimentation before implementation?
* What role can **design heuristics, modularity, and architectural thinking** play in managing complexity?

Evaluation and Adaptation

* How can we **evaluate and compare** alternative organizational designs?
* What metrics capture **organizational “fit”**, resilience, and learning capacity?
* How can a firm’s design **evolve over time** as it scales, diversifies, or reorients its strategy?

Dynamics and Interaction

* How does organizational design shape **internal and external dynamics** — coordination, responsiveness, and boundary permeability?
* How does structure influence **agency, cognition, and creativity** at individual and collective levels?
* How does organizational design **interact with workflow architectures** and **operational models**?

Control, Intelligence, and Feedback

* How can **self-modelling** and **feedback systems** be embedded to enhance reflection, learning, and adaptation?
* How should **authority, coordination, and communication** be distributed to balance **control and autonomy**?
* How can **cybernetic principles** (e.g., recursion, feedback, homeostasis) inform adaptive firm design?

Strategic and Technical Coupling

* How does the internal design relate to the firm’s **technical capacity**, **product space**, and **strategic intent**?
* How can design choices support both **stability (efficiency)** and **adaptability (innovation)** across technical and human systems?
* How can organizational design be aligned with the **firm’s technological, financial, and market architectures**?

Ecosystem and Boundary Design

* How should the **boundaries of the firm** be defined in relation to suppliers, partners, and institutions?
* How can organizational design enable **collaborative ecosystems**, knowledge exchange, and joint innovation?
* What are the **new forms of organization** emerging in digital, distributed, and platform-based economies?
