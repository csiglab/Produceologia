# Comercialization

Companies can export their products **in multiple ways**, depending on their size, strategy, and the nature of the product. Here are the main methods:

### ✅ **1. Direct Exporting**

* The company sells **directly to foreign customers** (businesses, retailers, or governments).
* Handles its own logistics, marketing, and customer relationships.

🔹 *Used by*: Large or experienced exporters
🔹 *Example*: A Japanese machinery maker selling turbines directly to a Brazilian energy firm.

---

### ✅ **2. Indirect Exporting via Intermediaries**

* The company sells to **a domestic or foreign intermediary** (e.g., trading house, distributor, or agent), which then resells in the target market.

🔹 *Used by*: Smaller firms or firms entering new markets
🔹 *Example*: A German chemical company selling to a global trading house like Marubeni, which then distributes in Southeast Asia.

---

### ✅ **3. Licensing, Franchising, or Contract Manufacturing**

* Instead of exporting goods, the company allows a foreign partner to **produce or sell under its brand**.

🔹 *Used by*: Consumer goods, pharma, or IP-intensive industries
🔹 *Example*: A U.S. apparel brand licensing its designs to a South Korean clothing firm.

---

### ✅ **4. Joint Ventures or Foreign Subsidiaries**

* The company sets up or partners with a **local firm abroad** to produce, market, or sell the product.

🔹 *Used by*: Capital-intensive industries or those needing local presence
🔹 *Example*: A French carmaker forming a joint venture with an Indian automaker to serve the South Asian market.
