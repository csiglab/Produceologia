# Operation

> **Firm Operation** refers to the set of coordinated and repeatable activities through which a firm transforms inputs into valuable outputs — products, services, or outcomes — in alignment with its strategic and organizational design.

> A **business process** is a structured sequence of tasks or activities that collectively produce a specific output or achieve a business objective.
