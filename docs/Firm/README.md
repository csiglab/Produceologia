## Firm Metrics

> …
> 

| **Metric** | **Description** | **Formula/Calculation** | **Usage/Application** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Total Factor Productivity (TFP)** | Measures efficiency by comparing output to combined inputs (labor, capital, etc.). | TFP = Output / (Weighted Inputs) | Assesses overall productivity; common in cross-industry comparisons. |
| **Labor Productivity** | Output per unit of labor input, typically measured as output per worker or hour worked. | Labor Productivity = Output / Labor Input | Used to compare efficiency across firms or sectors. |
| **Capital Productivity** | Measures output relative to capital input, reflecting efficiency of capital usage. | Capital Productivity = Output / Capital Input | Useful in capital-intensive industries. |
| **Return on Assets (ROA)** | Indicates how efficiently assets are used to generate profit. | ROA = Net Income / Total Assets | Assesses asset utilization efficiency; key in performance benchmarking. |
| **Revenue per Employee** | Calculates the revenue generated per employee, reflecting labor efficiency. | Revenue per Employee = Total Revenue / Number of Employees | Highlights productivity on a per-employee basis. |
| **Cost per Unit** | Average cost of producing a single unit, reflecting cost efficiency. | Cost per Unit = Total Costs / Total Output | Used to assess cost management and pricing strategies. |
| **Inventory Turnover Ratio** | Shows how often inventory is sold and replaced over a period, reflecting operational efficiency. | Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory | Helps optimize inventory levels and supply chain efficiency. |
| **Gross Margin** | Measures the percentage of revenue remaining after cost of goods sold, showing production efficiency. | Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue | Evaluates efficiency in production and pricing. |
| **Operating Margin** | Reflects efficiency of core business operations, excluding non-operational items. | Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue | Used for comparing core operational efficiency. |
| **Capacity Utilization** | Indicates the extent to which a firm uses its productive capacity. | Capacity Utilization = (Actual Output / Potential Output) * 100% | Measures efficiency in resource utilization. |
| **Minimum efficient scale (MES)** | … | .. | .. |
| **Fixed cost** | … | … |  |
| **Marginal cost** | … | … | … |
| **Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)** | Shows operating performance by removing effects of non-operational costs. |  |  |
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | Cost associated with acquiring a new customer, reflecting marketing efficiency. |  |  |
| **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)** | Expected total revenue from a customer over their relationship with the business. |  |  |
| **Market Share** | Percentage of total market revenue or volume captured by the enterprise. |  |  |
| **Proportion of Value Capture Along the Value Chain** | This term emphasizes the share or portion of total value that a firm retains at each stage of the value chain.  It considers the **distribution of captured value** across different activities or stakeholders, assessing how much value is kept by each stage versus how much is passed to other stages (e.g., suppliers, distributors). |  |  |
| Value Added | "Value added" refers to the **additional worth** created at each stage of the production or service process, calculated by subtracting input costs from the final product’s selling price.  It measures the **direct contribution** of each stage to the final product or service, highlighting the economic value generated by the firm or process.  |  |  |
