3. **Guest's Model of HRM:** Developed by David Guest, this model outlines the critical dimensions of HRM, including HR strategy, HR practices, HR outcomes, and behavioral outcomes.
4. **HR Value Chain Model:** Developed by John J. Kavanagh and Michael J. Thite, this model is based on the concept of the value chain, adapted to HR. It outlines HR activities from business strategy to HR outcomes.
5. **Ulrich's HR Model:** Dave Ulrich's model identifies four key roles of HR professionals: strategic partner, administrative expert, employee champion, and change agent. It is often referred to as the HR Business Partner Model.
