Here are some commonly recognized **HR Models**:

1. **Fombrun, Tichy, and Devanna's HR Model** emphasizes integrating HR and business strategies. It comprises four key components: selection, appraisal, development, and rewards.
2. **The Harvard Model:** Developed by Beer et al., this model views employees as stakeholders and emphasizes the importance of considering human and social factors in HR management.
3. **Guest's Model of HRM:** Developed by David Guest, this model outlines the critical dimensions of HRM, including HR strategy, HR practices, HR outcomes, and behavioral outcomes.
4. **HR Value Chain Model:** Developed by John J. Kavanagh and Michael J. Thite, this model is based on the concept of the value chain, adapted to HR. It outlines HR activities from business strategy to HR outcomes.
5. **Ulrich's HR Model:** Dave Ulrich's model identifies four key roles of HR professionals: strategic partner, administrative expert, employee champion, and change agent. It is often referred to as the HR Business Partner Model.

10. **The 7S Model:** Not exclusively an HR model but often used for organizational analysis, it includes Strategy, Structure, Systems, Shared Values, Skills, Style, and Staff.
11. **The Balanced Scorecard:** While initially designed for strategic management, it includes HR-related metrics as part of its framework, linking HR activities to overall organizational goals.
