## Value Chain

Here’s a breakdown of the **UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) value chain** along with the approximate percentage of the **cost structure** associated with producing the final product. 

The values are estimates and can vary significantly depending on the type of UAV (consumer, commercial, or military), the level of sophistication, and the region of production.

| **Stage** | **Activities/Components** | **Percentage of Cost Structure** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Research and Development** | Designing flight control systems, software, and new technology | 10-20% |
| **Raw Materials and Components** | Batteries, motors, GPS modules, cameras, sensors (LiDAR, infrared, etc.), communication systems, propellers, frames, etc. | 25-40% |
| **Manufacturing and Assembly** | Drone assembly, quality control, testing, and calibration | 20-30% |
| **Software Development** | Firmware, autopilot systems, data analytics platforms, cloud integration, flight planning software | 10-15% |
| **Sales and Distribution** | Sales channels (retailers, online platforms), marketing, and distribution logistics | 10-15% |
| **Regulation and Compliance** | Certification, licensing, meeting regulatory standards (FAA, EASA, etc.) | 5-10% |
| **Maintenance and Support** | After-sales service, repairs, technical support, software updates | 5-10% |
| **End-User Training** | Operator training and certification | <5% |
| **Data Analytics and Processing** | Processing and analysis of data collected by drones (AI, machine learning for image/sensor data interpretation) | 5-10% |
