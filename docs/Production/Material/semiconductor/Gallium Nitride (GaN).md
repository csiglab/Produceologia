# Gallium Nitride (GaN)

> Gallium nitride is a **synthetic chemical compound**â€”a **semiconductor material** used in high-performance electronics.
It's not found naturally in large quantities but is **manufactured in labs or factories** for industrial use.

> Gallium Nitride (GaN) is a wide-bandgap semiconductor material that has become a key technology for next-generation power electronics, RF (radio frequency) devices, and optoelectronics.

### âš¡ **Why GaN Matters**

#### âœ… **High Efficiency**

* Because of its **wide bandgap**, GaN can operate at **higher voltages, frequencies, and temperatures** than silicon (Si).
* It enables smaller, faster, and more efficient **power devices** (like transistors, inverters, and converters).

#### âœ… **Fast Switching**

* GaN switches **10â€“100x faster** than silicon, reducing energy loss and improving performance in:

  * Power adapters (for phones, laptops, EVs)
  * Data centers and 5G base stations
  * High-efficiency LED lighting
  * Aerospace and defense (radar, satellites)

#### âœ… **High Frequency**

* GaN is ideal for **RF and microwave applications**: itâ€™s used in **radars, 5G, satellite communications**, and electronic warfare.

## Who Buys GaN & In What Form?

Most companies do not buy raw GaNâ€”they purchase:

1. GaN Wafers (For chip fabrication)
    - Example: Apple buys GaN-on-silicon wafers for fast chargers.
2. GaN Power Transistors/ICs (Ready-to-use components)
    -  Example: Anker uses GaN ICs from Navitas in its chargers.

4. GaN RF Devices (For 5G, radar)
    - Example: Qualcomm buys GaN RF chips for 5G base stations.

Can You Buy GaN Directly?
-  No (for consumers) â€“ GaN is sold as part of finished products (e.g., chargers, LEDs).
-  Yes (for businesses) â€“ Companies like Wolfspeed sell GaN wafers to semiconductor fabs.
