# Steel

> Steel is an **alloy** of **iron** and **carbon** that demonstrates improved mechanical properties compared to the pure form of iron.

## Characterization

> Steel is usually classified based on chemical composition and microstructure as primary criteria, but real-world classification also considers heat treatment behavior, processing method, mechanical performance, surface treatment, and use case.
