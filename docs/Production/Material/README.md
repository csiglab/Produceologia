# Material

> A **raw material** is an unprocessed or minimally processed natural or synthetic substance that serves as the primary input in a manufacturing or transformation process, possessing intrinsic physical, chemical, or biological properties that determine its suitability for conversion into intermediate or final products.

## 🌍 Global Industrial Material Usage Shares

| **Material**             | **Annual Production**         | **Approximate % of Total Material Use** | **Notes & Context**                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concrete**             | \~33 billion t/year           | \~30–40 %                               | Most-consumed human-made material after water([reddit.com][1]); in construction, \~65.7 % of material volume([wired.com][2]). |
| **Cement**               | \~4–4.5 billion t/year        | \~5 % (as binder)                       | Cement is component of concrete. Worldwide = \~4 % of global emissions; massive consumption.                                  |
| **Steel (iron & steel)** | \~1.8 billion t/year          | \~15–20 %                               | Steel dominates metals/mining revenues; \~60–70 % of metals/mining; \~8.8 % of construction materials use.                    |
| **Aluminum**             | \~60 million t/year (primary) | \~1–2 %                                 | Second-most abundant metal used; per capita \~80 kg; \~33 % recycled.                                                         |
| **Plastics (polymers)**  | \~370–400 million t/year      | \~3–4 %                                 | Polymer output \~80 % of chemicals industry; packaging \~40 % of use.                                                         |
| **Composites**           | \~13 million t/year           | <1 % (by volume)                        | Niche materials in aerospace, high-end construction; their mass is small relative to bulk materials.                          |
