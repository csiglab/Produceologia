# ⚓ Shipbuilding Industry

> The **Shipbuilding Industry** designs, constructs, and repairs ships and other floating vessels, including cargo ships, tankers, passenger ships, naval vessels, and offshore structures such as oil rigs. It involves a wide range of engineering disciplines — naval architecture, marine engineering, and materials science — and integrates large-scale metal fabrication, propulsion systems, and advanced control systems. Shipbuilding is a **strategic heavy industry**, often linked to national defense, maritime trade, and industrial capability.
