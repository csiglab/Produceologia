# Textile Productive Ecosystem

> The **textile industry** is the sector of manufacturing that focuses on the production of fibers, yarns, fabrics, and textile products. It forms the upstream part of the apparel and home textile supply chain and is considered light industry because it primarily produces consumer goods rather than heavy machinery or raw materials like steel.
