# Program Production

> **How to Produce Software 1.0 (Program)?** Software 1.0 refers to traditional software: source code written by human developers using deterministic logic, algorithms, and data structures to solve well-specified problems.

## Formulation

> **What is a Software 1.0 (Program)?**

Software 1.0 is a human-authored, static set of instructions (source code) that executes on a computing platform to perform a defined function or service. It is characterized by:

- Explicit logic written in programming languages (e.g., Python, C++, Java)
- Deterministic behavior (given same inputs, produces same outputs)
- Verifiable correctness through testing, formal methods, or code review
- Manual design of algorithms, data flows, and control structures

Software production is not just code generation.

It is a **recursive socio-technical adaptive system** involving:

* Economic modeling
* Institutional design
* Epistemic production
* Human cognition
* Distributed computation
* Legal frameworks
* Evolutionary feedback loops
