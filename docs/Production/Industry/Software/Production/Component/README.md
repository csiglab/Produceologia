TODO:

- Query Execution Engine
- Execution Plan
- The Concept of Cardinality
- Be able to trace network calls.
- We have a stream of problems—bugs—coming from a given software system. Can we really improve the software by looking at the bugs in isolation? For example, if we assign them to different programmers, will that approach lead to meaningful system improvements?
    - Key concepts to elaborate and answer - synergies between bugs - solutions. Connection Between Bugs. Deep underlying patters.

Programming Tips:

- Satinize File Path for Storage? What security problems can this entail if not done?

Monitoring:

- HA Proxy

Fast App Prototyping:

- Authentication Provider
- State Model Storage  Mechanism → Relational DB,  Documents DB, … Postgrest Rest
- **PostgREST** → instant REST API for your tables, views, and RPCs
- **Realtime engine** → websocket-based subscription to database changes
- **Auth** → user management, JWTs, Row Level Security integration
- **Storage** → file/object storage with access control
- **Edge Functions** → serverless functions for custom logic
- **Dashboard** → visual SQL editor, table view, API explorer
