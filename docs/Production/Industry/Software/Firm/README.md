# Firm Organization Model

> Which are the firms organization models (structures) production model?

| **Organization Model**                            | **Description**                                                                                         | **Evaluation (Strengths / Weaknesses)**                                                                                           | **Tags**                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Functional Organization**                       | Teams grouped by discipline (Backend, Frontend, QA, Ops, Security). Work flows across departments.      | **+** Deep specialization, strong expertise. **–** Slow delivery, handoff bottlenecks, silo formation.                            | specialization; waterfall; large firms            |
| **Cross-Functional / Product Teams**              | Stable, end-to-end teams owning a product or service (PM + Eng + Design + QA + Ops).                    | **+** Fast delivery; high ownership; fewer handoffs. **–** More coordination across teams; possible duplication of expertise.     | agile; DevOps; product-led                        |
| **Stream-Aligned Teams (Team Topologies)**        | Teams aligned to a continuous flow of value for a user or domain; supported by enabling/platform teams. | **+** High flow, reduced cognitive load, scalable. **–** Requires maturity in platform/enablement roles.                          | modern; DevOps; Team Topologies                   |
| **Platform Team Model**                           | A team provides reusable internal platforms (CI, infra, observability, dev tooling) for product teams.  | **+** Reduces duplication; accelerates delivery. **–** Risk of platform bloat; must operate like an internal product.             | platform engineering; internal developer platform |
| **Matrix Organization**                           | Engineers belong to a functional home (career ladder) but work on cross-functional project teams.       | **+** Balances specialization & product delivery. **–** Dual reporting lines cause conflict; coordination overhead.               | hybrid; enterprise                                |
| **Component-Based / Subsystem Teams**             | Teams own specific components (e.g., “Payments”, “Storage”, “Compiler Backend”).                        | **+** Deep subsystem expertise; stable ownership. **–** Cross-cutting features require many teams → slow delivery.                | architecture-driven; large systems                |
| **Feature Teams**                                 | Teams that deliver features end-to-end across systems, temporarily or permanently.                      | **+** Faster feature development; customer-oriented. **–** Can result in shallow subsystem understanding; architectural drift.    | agile; feature-driven                             |
| **Project-Based Organization**                    | Teams assembled temporarily for a specific project; dissolved after completion.                         | **+** Flexible allocation; short-term optimization. **–** Loss of institutional knowledge; unstable teams; burnout risk.          | consulting; outsourcing; agencies                 |
| **Centers of Excellence (CoEs)**                  | Specialized expert groups (AI/ML, Security, Performance) supporting other teams.                        | **+** Concentrates rare expertise; improves quality. **–** Often becomes a bottleneck; unclear boundaries.                        | governance; enterprise                            |
| **Guilds / Chapters (Spotify Model)**             | Communities of practice cutting across squads (e.g., “Mobile Guild”, “Testing Chapter”).                | **+** Knowledge sharing; standardization emerges organically. **–** Difficult to maintain; often becomes symbolic.                | agile; culture                                    |
| **Open-Source / Meritocratic Model**              | Distributed contributors, loose governance, decisions by consensus or maintainers.                      | **+** Global talent; high innovation; transparency. **–** Coordination challenges; uneven code quality; volunteer burnout.        | open-source; distributed                          |
| **Remote-First / Fully Distributed**              | Organization optimized for asynchronous work, documentation, and autonomy.                              | **+** Access to global talent; high autonomy; cost efficiency. **–** Requires strong documentation culture; time-zone challenges. | remote; async; distributed                        |
| **Hierarchical Bureaucratic (Legacy Enterprise)** | Strong vertical hierarchy, formal processes, strict controls.                                           | **+** Predictable, controlled operations; clear authority. **–** Extremely slow change; poor adaptability; low innovation.        | enterprise; 
waterfall                             |
