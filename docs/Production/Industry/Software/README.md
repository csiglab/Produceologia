# Digital Production Sector

> In this note we will analyze several aspects of the software industry — as an overview — with links to Bremontix and to the entire production process, including market analysis and related topics.

> Digital Production Sector.

> Note: This note is highly unfinished, including its formulation. Open question: Does a newsfeed aggregator — a type of software — belong within the Digital Production Sector?

Guiding Questions:

* What is the *product space* of the software industry? What is the structure of production inside a software firm?
* What is the *technical space* of the industry? How technical research works?
  - Are software techniques *operational*, or something else? For example, is a technique for implementing a hash table an operational technique? Or is it considered operational because it functions as part of the language’s building blocks?
* What are the *markets* of the industry?
* (Add more guiding questions as needed.)

## Product Space Taxonomy

> Guiding Question: What types of products does the Digital Sector produce?

> Note: To map the digital sector effectively, it is better to begin with the digital product space, since many industry classifications are arbitrary. For example, the gaming industry produces “games,” yet these are also part of the broader software publishing sector. Starting from products avoids artificial boundaries.

### Structure

> Goal: To provide a comprehensive and structured framework for tagging and classifying digital products across four orthogonal dimensions. Each dimension captures a different aspect of the product’s purpose, form, implementation, and market context.

> How to structure the space?

**Role Dimension**: The Role of a product exhibits a dual structure:

* **Primary** Intent—the immediate function the product performs; and
* **Secondary** Function—the broader capabilities, interactions, or system behaviors that the product facilitates.

| **Dimension**        | **Description**                                          | **Value**     | **Value Description**                                                              |
