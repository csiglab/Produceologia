# Software Industry

> In this note we will analyze several aspects of the software industry — as an overview — with links to Bremontix and to the entire production process, including market analysis and related topics.

Guiding Questions:

* What is the *product space* of the software industry? What is the structure of production inside a software firm?
* What is the *technical space* of the industry? How technical research works?
    - Are software techniques *operational*, or something else? For example, is a technique for implementing a hash table an operational technique? Or is it considered operational because it functions as part of the language’s building blocks?
* What are the *markets* of the industry?
* (Add more guiding questions as needed.)
