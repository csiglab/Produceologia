# 🎨 Creative Industry(s)

> **Note:** This framework is intended as a **content organization tool** rather than a rigorous analytical concept. The term “creative industry” is very broad, so this structure is primarily useful for **categorizing content**, not for detailed economic or strategic analysis.

> **Alternaives Names**: Creative Sector, Cultural & Creative Industries, Orange Economy, Experience Economy.

## Formulation

> What types of products are generated by Creative Industry Firms? What characteristics qualify a firm as part of the creative economy? What attributes or qualities make a product part of the Creative Industry?

> **Leisure consumption** is a common use case of creative products, but the essential criterion is that the product’s value comes from creativity and cultural/intellectual content, not just relaxation or entertainment.

> If removing the creative/artistic/cultural element makes the product essentially worthless, it belongs to the creative industry.

## Appendix

1. On Definition: Claiming that every product belongs to the creative industry simply because it has some artistic or design value—whether for leisure or not—implies that almost all products would qualify. This is problematic, as nearly every consumer product incorporates some level of design or aesthetic consideration, which would make the definition overly broad and meaningless.
