# Metallurgical Industry

> The Metallurgical Industry extracts, refines, and processes metal ores into usable metals and alloys. It focuses on metal production and transformation at the material level (chemical and physical processes)

> The Metalworking Industry shapes, machines, and assembles finished or semi-finished metal products. It focuses on mechanical transformation of metals into components, tools, and structures.
