# 🧱 Material Industry

> The **Material Industry** encompasses all sectors involved in the **production, processing, and refinement of raw and engineered materials** used across manufacturing, construction, energy, and technology. It includes the extraction of metals and minerals, the production of nonmetallic and chemical materials, and the development of advanced materials such as composites, polymers, and nanomaterials. The industry provides the **foundational inputs** upon which virtually all other industries depend — forming the base of industrial capability and technological progress.
