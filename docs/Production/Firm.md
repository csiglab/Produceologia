# Firm

> A Firm is an organized economic entity that coordinates resources, activities, and human effort to produce goods, services, or value for exchange in a market or social context.

This template introduces a structured methodology to model a firm across three analytical layers:

1. Microeconomic model (production, cost, incentives),
2. Institutional model (governance, contracts, organizational structure),
3. Capabilities model (learning, innovation, routines, evolutionary dynamics).

## Agency

### Internal Organization

> How to characterie the internal structure of a firm?

> Let’s use the **Viable System Model (VSM)** to understand how a firm’s internal organization can be structured for adaptability, resilience, and efficient decision-making.

The VSM provides a framework to model an organization as a set of interacting subsystems, each responsible for specific functions: operations, coordination, control, strategy, and environmental scanning. By mapping a firm’s internal structure to these subsystems, we can design recursive and autonomous units that maintain viability in a changing environment.

Key principles of VSM applied to a firm:

1. **System 1 – Operations:** Core activities that produce value.
2. **System 2 – Coordination:** Mechanisms to synchronize and stabilize operations.
3. **System 3 – Control:** Management of resources, performance monitoring, and operational optimization.
4. **System 3* – Audit/Monitoring:** Independent oversight to detect deviations or emerging risks.
5. **System 4 – Strategy & Adaptation:** Environmental scanning, planning, and strategic development.
6. **System 5 – Policy & Identity:** Governance, vision, and the organization’s guiding principles.

Using VSM allows the firm to maintain **structural integrity while adapting dynamically** to internal and external changes.

| **Evolutionary Models (Nelson–Winter, Metcalfe)** | Growth driven by routines, search, variation, and selection; path-dependent innovation.                                                  | Industry dynamics; technological change; simulation models.         |
| **Resource-Based Growth**                         | Growth through accumulating, recombining, and deploying heterogeneous resources and capabilities.                                        | Capability building; strategic asset evaluation.                    |
| **Experience Curve / Learning Curve**             | Learning-by-doing leads to cost reductions, which reinforce scale expansion.                                                             | Cost modeling; production strategy; competitive dynamics.           |
| **Greiner’s Growth Model**                        | Growth proceeds through structural stages (Creativity → Direction → Delegation → Coordination → Collaboration), each ending in a crisis. | Organizational design; diagnosing scaling challenges.               |
| **Churchill & Lewis Stages**                      | SME growth through Existence → Survival → Success → Takeoff → Resource Maturity; focus on cash flow, systems, and management.            | Entrepreneurial scaling; SME strategy.                              |
| **Scott & Bruce SME Model**                       | Inception → Survival → Growth → Expansion → Maturity; emphasizes management systems and financial requirements.                          | SME financing; operational decision-making.                         |
| **Kazanjian’s Technology Venture Model**          | Technology ventures pass through Development → Commercialization → Growth → Stability; constrained by tech–market fit.                   | Tech startup assessment; productization and scaling readiness.      |
| **Miller & Friesen Organizational Life Cycle**    | Firms evolve through Birth → Growth → Maturity → Revival or Decline; structure and strategy change over time.                            | Long-term strategic planning; lifecycle diagnosis.                  |
