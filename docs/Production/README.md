# Production

> **Production** is a process of transforming inputs (like labor, raw materials, energy, and capital) into goods or services that satisfy human needs or demands.

> **Production Chain**: the sequence of processes and activities through which raw materials and inputs are transformed step by step into finished goods or services, ready for consumption or further production.

> "Industry is not a movable object... At its core, it is an organizational and social capacity—and it is this capacity that determines the effectiveness of physical capital." — Lu Feng
