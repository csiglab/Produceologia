# Production

> **Production** is a process of transforming inputs (like labor, raw materials, energy, and capital) into goods or services that satisfy human needs or demands.

> **Production Chain**: the sequence of processes and activities through which raw materials and inputs are transformed step by step into finished goods or services, ready for consumption or further production.

> "Industry is not a movable object... At its core, it is an organizational and social capacity—and it is this capacity that determines the effectiveness of physical capital." — Lu Feng

> Enterprises have a very deep relationship with suppliers → almost a **symbiotic one**.  So Industrial policy perce - as buy local cannot create an suppliers ecosystem - China was helped by the US in jump-starting there industry.

## Terminology

| **Term**                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Economies of scope**   | Cost advantages from producing **multiple different products jointly**, leveraging shared inputs, capabilities, or infrastructure, so that total cost is lower than producing each output independently.                         |
| **Economies of density** | Cost advantages from **concentrating production, distribution, or consumption in a specific geographic area**—allowing more efficient infrastructure use, higher utilization rates, shorter distances, and lower per-unit costs. |
| **Economies of scale**   | Cost advantages from **increasing the volume of production**, allowing fixed costs to be spread out, improving specialization, and raising operational efficiency, thus reducing average cost per unit.                          |
