## Formulation

> A **firm** is a *bounded, goal-oriented, socio-technical system* that mobilizes and coordinates resources, capabilities, and knowledge to produce and exchange value within an environment.

It acts through:

* **Intentional agency** (vision, goals, strategy)
* **Operational capacities** (technical, human, financial, organizational)
* **Market interfaces** (customers, partners, institutions)
* **Reflexive representations** (brand, identity, reputation)
* **Evolutionary learning** (innovation, adaptation, internal change)

### Internal Organization

> How to characterie the internal structure of a firm?

> Let’s use the **Viable System Model (VSM)** to understand how a firm’s internal organization can be structured for adaptability, resilience, and efficient decision-making.

The VSM provides a framework to model an organization as a set of interacting subsystems, each responsible for specific functions: operations, coordination, control, strategy, and environmental scanning. By mapping a firm’s internal structure to these subsystems, we can design recursive and autonomous units that maintain viability in a changing environment.

Key principles of VSM applied to a firm:

1. **System 1 – Operations:** Core activities that produce value.
2. **System 2 – Coordination:** Mechanisms to synchronize and stabilize operations.
3. **System 3 – Control:** Management of resources, performance monitoring, and operational optimization.
4. **System 3* – Audit/Monitoring:** Independent oversight to detect deviations or emerging risks.
5. **System 4 – Strategy & Adaptation:** Environmental scanning, planning, and strategic development.
6. **System 5 – Policy & Identity:** Governance, vision, and the organization’s guiding principles.

Using VSM allows the firm to maintain **structural integrity while adapting dynamically** to internal and external changes.
