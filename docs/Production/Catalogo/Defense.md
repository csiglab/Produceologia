## Technology

1. **Radar:** A technology that uses radio waves to detect and locate objects, particularly aircraft and ships, by analyzing the echoes of the transmitted signals.
2. **Satellite Communication:** Communication systems utilizing satellites to transmit data, voice, and video signals over long distances, enabling secure and global connectivity.
3. **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or Drones):** Aircraft without a human pilot on board, controlled remotely or autonomously, used for surveillance, reconnaissance, and sometimes combat.
4. **Encryption Technology:** Methods to encode information to ensure secure communication and prevent unauthorized access, commonly used to protect sensitive military data.
5. **Cybersecurity Systems:**  Technologies and practices designed to protect computer systems, networks, and data from cyber threats, including hacking and malware attacks.
6. **Ballistic Missiles:** Guided missiles designed for long-range delivery and often equipped with nuclear, chemical, or conventional warheads.
7. **Stealth Technology:** Techniques and materials used to make military aircraft and vehicles less visible to radar and other detection methods.
8. **Electronic Warfare Systems:**  Technologies that use electromagnetic spectrum manipulation to disrupt or deceive enemy communication and radar systems.
9. **Biometric Identification:** Technologies like fingerprint or facial recognition used for secure identification of personnel accessing military facilities or systems.
10. **Directed Energy Weapons:**  Weapons that emit focused energy, such as lasers or high-powered microwaves, for precise and rapid target engagement.
11. **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**  Intelligent systems that can analyze data, learn, and make decisions, used in defense for tasks like autonomous vehicles and strategic planning.
12. **Underwater Drones:**  Unmanned vehicles designed for underwater operations, including surveillance, reconnaissance, and mine detection.
13. **Advanced Materials:** High-performance materials designed for military applications, providing enhanced strength, durability, and resistance to extreme conditions.
14. **Biological and Chemical Detection Systems:** Technologies for detecting and identifying biological and chemical agents, ensuring early warning and protection.
