> **Biobased economy**, **bioeconomy** or **biotechonomy** is economic activity involving the use of [biotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology) and [biomass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass) in the production of goods, services, or energy.
> 

> The main products of the **bio-economy** span a wide range of sectors, leveraging biological resources to produce sustainable alternatives to traditional products.
> 

Some of the key products include:

1. **Biofuels**: Biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel are produced from biomass sources like corn, sugarcane, soybeans, and algae. These renewable fuels serve as alternatives to fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting energy security.
2. **Biomaterials**: Biomaterials are derived from biological sources and find applications in various industries. Examples include bioplastics, which are made from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane, and bio-based textiles made from plant fibers like cotton, hemp, or bamboo.
3. **Biochemicals**: Bio-based chemicals are produced through biological processes or biomass conversion techniques. They include a wide range of products such as organic acids, enzymes, solvents, and surfactants used in industries like pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and agriculture.
4. **Biopharmaceuticals**: Biopharmaceuticals are drugs derived from biological sources or produced using biotechnology techniques. Examples include vaccines, antibodies, hormones, and enzymes used for medical treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of diseases.
5. **Bioplastics**: Bioplastics are a type of plastic that is biodegradable or derived from renewable resources. They can be used in packaging, consumer products, automotive parts, and other applications, offering a more sustainable alternative to traditional plastics derived from fossil fuels.
6. **Bio-based Lubricants**: Lubricants derived from biological sources, such as vegetable oils or animal fats, offer environmentally friendly alternatives to petroleum-based lubricants. They are used in automotive, industrial, and marine applications.
7. **Bio-based Fertilizers**: Bio-based fertilizers are derived from organic materials such as compost, manure, or plant residues. They provide essential nutrients to plants while improving soil fertility and reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers, thereby promoting sustainable agriculture.

Biotechnology in agriculture involves the use of genetic engineering, molecular biology, and other advanced techniques to improve crops, increase yields, and address various challenges in farming. Here is a list of biotechnologies and biotech products commonly used in agriculture:

1. **Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs):**
    - Genetically modified crops engineered for traits such as resistance to pests, diseases, and herbicides, as well as improved nutritional content.
    - Examples include Bt cotton, Bt corn, and Roundup Ready soybeans.
2. **Genome Editing Techniques:**
    - CRISPR-Cas9 and other genome editing technologies are used to precisely modify the DNA of crops for desired traits.
    - Applications include creating crops with enhanced resistance to diseases, improved nutritional profiles, and longer shelf life.
3. **Biopesticides:**
    - Biological pesticides derived from living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, or viruses, to control pests and diseases.
    - Examples include Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for insect control and Trichoderma spp. for disease control.
4. **Plant Tissue Culture:**
    - In vitro propagation of plants from small tissue samples to produce disease-free and genetically identical plants.
    - Used for rapid multiplication of elite plant varieties.
5. **RNA Interference (RNAi):**
    - Utilizes small RNA molecules to selectively silence or suppress specific genes in crops.
    - Applications include pest resistance and improved post-harvest storage.
6. **Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS):**
    - Molecular markers are used to identify and select plants with desired traits without the need for phenotypic observation.
    - Accelerates the traditional breeding process.
7. **Seed Biotechnology:**
    - Development of biotech-enhanced seeds with traits such as drought tolerance, disease resistance, and improved yield.
    - Includes the use of advanced breeding techniques and genetic modification.
8. **Synthetic Biology:**
    - Design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems for agricultural applications.
    - Used in creating custom-designed microbes for nutrient fixation and soil improvement.
9. **Biofortification:**
    - Enhancement of the nutritional content of crops through genetic modification or conventional breeding.
    - Examples include Golden Rice, engineered to produce beta-carotene (provitamin A).
10. **Vaccines for Livestock:**
    - Development of genetically engineered vaccines for livestock to enhance disease resistance.
    - Improves animal health and reduces the need for traditional vaccinations.
11. **Phytoremediation:**
    - Use of genetically modified plants to absorb, accumulate, or detoxify pollutants in the soil.
    - Aims to remediate contaminated environments.
12. **Digital Agriculture and Biotech Data Analytics:**
    - Integration of biotechnology with data analytics for precision agriculture.
    - Helps optimize crop management, resource use, and decision-making on the farm.
