## Failures

> Digital Transformation Going Wrong
> 

Here is my summary of the mistakes Hertz made: - hired the vendor based on a cool demo & vendor size - did not have a Hertz employee as Product Owner - tried to go big fast instead of taking an iterative approach - did not implement proper tests & validation - spent $10M without building internal skills.

Disclaimer: I am biased here as I am a consultant, and our business model is to help our customers with their digital transformation while teaching them DevOps and cloud technology.

$10M for a project of this size and importance is not unreasonable. The big mistake is that they didn't plan to take ownership of the project and learn the skills required to carry it forward without Accenture.

## Digital Transformation: Problems

- **Cybersecurity Risks**: As businesses increase their digital footprints, they become more vulnerable to cyberattacks, data breaches, and other security threats.
- **Data Privacy Concerns**: With the increase in data usage, organizations face heightened challenges related to data privacy, requiring compliance with complex regulatory environments.
- **Integration Complexity**:  Integrating new digital solutions with existing systems can be complex and disruptive, often requiring significant time and resources.
- **Over-reliance on Data**: While data-driven decision-making is advantageous, it can lead to challenges if the data quality could be better or the analysis needs to be understood.
- **Cost of Implementation**: Upfront investments in new technologies and systems can be substantial, and the ongoing cost of maintaining and updating these digital tools is also significant.

## **General Digital Transformation Success Factors**

> **Note:** Industries like manufacturing present unique challenges; therefore, it is crucial to independently assess and tailor these factors to fit specific local contexts.
> 

Here are three of the most critical success factors for digital transformation:

1. **Clear Vision and Objectives** are essential for successful digital transformation, providing a strategic roadmap that aligns efforts, guides decision-making, and ensures stakeholder alignment.
2. **Engage managers and employees**: This involves involving management and staff in the transformation process to ensure they are committed, informed, and motivated to contribute to and embrace the changes.
3. **Develop a digital business strategy**:  The more involved an entity is in the digital ecosystem, the greater the impact digitalization will inherently have. This refers to creating a comprehensive plan outlining how digital technologies will achieve business goals and improve operations, ensuring alignment with the organization's objectives.
4. **Well-managed transformation activities**: This factor emphasizes the importance of effectively organizing, coordinating, and overseeing all activities related to digital transformation to ensure they are executed on time, within budget, and to the desired standards.
5. **Leverage external and internal knowledge**: This involves utilizing knowledge from inside and outside the organization to inform and enhance the transformation process. It could include consulting industry experts, adopting best practices, learning from other companies' experiences, and tapping into the skills and insights of internal employees.
