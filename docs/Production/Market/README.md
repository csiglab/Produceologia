## Market

> A market is a complex adaptive system consisting of interacting economic agents (individuals, firms, institutions) who exchange goods, services, or rights through structured and unstructured protocols, where allocation decisions emerge from the decentralized processing of incomplete, local information, and are mediated through price signals, contracts, or other coordination mechanisms.

| Component                 | Technical Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agents**                | Autonomous decision-makers with preferences, constraints, and objectives (e.g. profit maximization, utility maximization).                                        |
| **Goods/Services**        | Objects of exchange with defined or emergent value (tangible, intangible, digital, financial).                                                                    |
| **Exchange Rules**        | Legal, algorithmic, or institutional protocols for transactions (e.g. auctions, fixed price, barter).                                                             |
| **Prices/Signals**        | Encoded information about relative scarcity and desirability, often serving as decentralized coordination tools.                                                  |
| **Information Asymmetry** | Agents typically have unequal or incomplete knowledge, leading to dynamics like adverse selection or signaling.                                                   |
| **Institutions**          | Regulatory frameworks or platforms (e.g. clearinghouses, marketplaces, blockchain protocols) that reduce transaction costs, enforce contracts, or shape behavior. |
| **Dynamics**              | Markets evolve through feedback loops, adaptive expectations, learning, and shocks (e.g., demand surges, policy changes).                                         |


| Layer             | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ontological**   | A distributed mechanism of coordination under scarcity.                          |
| **Epistemic**     | An information-processing system that aggregates local preferences.              |
| **Computational** | A decentralized algorithm that converges (or fails to) to efficient allocations. |
| **Institutional** | Embedded in rules, norms, and platforms that enable or constrain behavior.       |
| **Evolutionary**  | Adaptive over time through innovation, feedback, and systemic shocks.            |


**🔁 Market as a Distributed Algorithm**

From a computational or systems-theoretic lens:
- A market computes an allocation of resources given local inputs and decentralized decision-making.
- In general equilibrium theory, markets are modeled as systems solving a set of interdependent nonlinear equations, where supply equals demand across all goods.
- In mechanism design, markets are constructed to incentivize truthful revelation of preferences under constraints (e.g., Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auctions).

### Taxonomy

> Veblen Goods Theory

> Conspicuous Consumption (Thorstein Veblen)

> Functional vs Expressive Consumption

> Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs


- Digital vs Physical: Online marketplaces vs brick-and-mortar.

- Centralized vs Decentralized: Exchange-based vs peer-to-peer (e.g., blockchain DEXs).

- Single-sided vs Two-sided: One type of agent vs platforms connecting buyers and sellers.

- Commodity vs Differentiated Goods: Fungible vs unique.

- Utility vs Non-Utility vs  Hybrid Products: Utility + Symbolism
