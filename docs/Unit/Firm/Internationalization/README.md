##  Models

You want to know about **firms’ models of internationalization** — basically, frameworks or theories that explain how and why companies expand their operations into foreign markets.

### 1. **Uppsala Model (Stage Model)**

* **Origin:** Developed by Johanson and Vahlne (1977).
* **Core idea:** Firms internationalize gradually, starting with markets that are culturally and geographically close.
* **Stages:**

  * No regular export activities.
  * Export via independent agents.
  * Establishment of sales subsidiaries.
  * Foreign production/manufacturing.
* **Key concept:** Firms accumulate market knowledge and reduce uncertainty incrementally before deeper commitment.


### 2. **Eclectic Paradigm (OLI Model)**

* **Origin:** John Dunning (1979).
* **Core idea:** Firms go international based on three advantages:

  * **O**wnership advantages (unique assets, technology, brand).
  * **L**ocation advantages (benefits of operating in a foreign country, e.g., resources, market size).
  * **I**nternalization advantages (benefits of controlling foreign operations internally vs licensing).
* Explains why firms choose foreign direct investment (FDI) over exporting or licensing.

### 3. **Transaction Cost Theory**

* Firms internationalize to minimize transaction costs associated with cross-border business (e.g., costs of searching, negotiating, enforcing contracts).
* If external market transactions are costly or risky, firms internalize activities through subsidiaries abroad.
* Helps explain entry mode choice (exporting, joint ventures, wholly owned subsidiaries).


### 4. **Network Model**

* Emphasizes the importance of business networks and relationships.
* Firms internationalize by leveraging existing relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners.
* Entry into foreign markets often happens through networks or collaborations.

### 5. **Born Global and International New Ventures**

* Describes firms that internationalize rapidly, often soon after founding.
* Common in high-tech or knowledge-intensive sectors.
* These firms do not follow the gradual Uppsala pattern but “leapfrog” directly to global markets.

### 6. **Innovation-Related Models**

* Firms internationalize when innovation in products or processes creates competitive advantage.
* Internationalization is a way to exploit innovations in larger/global markets.

## Strategies

> Here’s a clear summary of common **internationalization strategies** that enterprises use when expanding into foreign markets. These strategies define **how** a company enters and operates internationally.

## Key Internationalization Strategies for Enterprises

### 1. **Exporting**

* **Direct Exporting:** Firm sells products directly to customers or distributors in the foreign market.
* **Indirect Exporting:** Uses intermediaries (export agents or trading companies) to sell abroad.
* **Pros:** Low risk, low investment.
* **Cons:** Less control, limited market presence.

### 2. **Licensing and Franchising**

* **Licensing:** Company allows a foreign firm to use its intellectual property (brand, patents, technology) in exchange for royalties.
* **Franchising:** Similar to licensing but often includes a complete business model (e.g., McDonald’s).
* **Pros:** Low risk and capital commitment.
* **Cons:** Limited control and risk of knowledge leakage.

### 3. **Joint Ventures (JV) and Strategic Alliances**

* **Joint Venture:** Partnership where a foreign and local firm create a new entity sharing ownership and risks.
* **Strategic Alliance:** Less formal partnership focused on cooperation without equity sharing.
* **Pros:** Shared risk, local market knowledge, access to resources.
* **Cons:** Potential conflicts, shared profits, complexity in management.

### 4. **Wholly Owned Subsidiaries**

* Company fully owns the foreign operation, either by acquisition or building from scratch (greenfield investment).
* **Pros:** Full control, protects technology/brand.
* **Cons:** High investment, high risk, complex management.

### 5. **Turnkey Projects**

* Company designs, builds, and equips a facility abroad, then transfers it to local operators.
* Common in large infrastructure or industrial projects.
* **Pros:** Revenue from expertise without long-term commitment.
* **Cons:** Limited presence, no ongoing market control.

### 6. **Contract Manufacturing / Outsourcing**

* Company contracts local firms abroad to produce goods.
* **Pros:** Cost savings, flexibility.
* **Cons:** Less control on quality and supply chain.

### Choosing a Strategy: Factors to Consider

* **Market potential and size**
* **Cultural and institutional distance**
* **Control vs risk tolerance**
* **Resource availability**
* **Competitive environment**
* **Technology sensitivity**
