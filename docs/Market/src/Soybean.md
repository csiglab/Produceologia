**Glycine max**, commonly known as soybean, is a highly versatile crop that yields various derivatives used in multiple industries.  Here are some significant derivatives of *Glycine max*:

### 1. **Soybean Oil**

- **Primary Use**: Used as cooking oil, in food processing, and in the manufacture of biodiesel. It is rich in polyunsaturated fats, including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.
- **Source**: Soybean oil is extracted from the seeds of *Glycine max*, typically through mechanical pressing or solvent extraction.

### 2. **Soy Protein**

- **Primary Use**: A key ingredient in plant-based foods, soy protein is widely used in vegetarian and vegan products. It's also used in animal feed, particularly for livestock and poultry.
- **Source**: Soy protein is obtained by processing defatted soy flour and is available in various forms like soy protein isolate, concentrate, and textured vegetable protein (TVP).

### 3. **Soy Lecithin**

- **Primary Use**: Soy lecithin is a widely used emulsifier in food products such as chocolates, margarine, and salad dressings. It helps blend ingredients that usually donâ€™t mix, like oil and water.
- **Source**: Lecithin is derived from soybeans during the oil extraction process.

### 4. **Soy Isoflavones**

- **Primary Use**: Isoflavones are plant-derived compounds with estrogen-like effects, often marketed for health benefits, particularly for menopausal women. They're used in supplements and functional foods.
- **Source**: Extracted from soybeans, specifically from soybean hulls or other soy byproducts.

### 5. **Soybean Meal**

- **Primary Use**: A major protein source in animal feed, particularly for poultry and pigs. Soybean meal is the byproduct of oil extraction and is used as a high-protein ingredient in both animal and aquaculture feeds.
- **Source**: Soybean meal is produced after the extraction of soybean oil.

### 6. **Soy Flour**

- **Primary Use**: Used in baking as an alternative to wheat flour, it is often added to gluten-free recipes. It's also a key ingredient in meat substitutes and certain processed foods.
- **Source**: Produced by grinding dehulled, roasted soybeans into a fine powder.

### 7. **Biodiesel**

- **Primary Use**: Soybean oil is one of the most common feedstocks for biodiesel production, a renewable energy source used in vehicles and machinery.
- **Source**: Transesterification of soybean oil yields biodiesel, a more environmentally friendly alternative to petroleum-based diesel.

### 8. **Soybean-Based Plastics**

- **Primary Use**: Biodegradable plastics made from soy protein are used in the automotive and packaging industries. These plastics are seen as an eco-friendly alternative to petroleum-based plastics.
- **Source**: Processed from soy protein, these materials can be used in creating composite materials.

### 9. **Soybean Hulls and Fiber**

- **Primary Use**: Soybean hulls are used as animal feed, fiber additives, and even in producing eco-friendly building materials.
- **Source**: The outer shells of the soybean seeds, which are typically discarded during oil extraction, can be processed into useful byproducts.
