# News Aggregation

> News Aggregation is the automated collection, organization, and presentation of news content from multiple sources in a single platform. Aggregators typically pull content via RSS feeds, APIs, or web scraping and present it in a consolidated, searchable, or personalized format.

## Business Model

- Ad-supported – Free access, monetized through display, native, or programmatic ads.
- Subscription / Premium – Paid plans for ad-free or curated content.
- B2B Services – Selling curated feeds, analytics, or API access to other businesses.

## Key Considerations

- Legality: Must respect copyright; aggregators often use snippets with links back to the original source.
- Algorithms & Personalization: Determines what content users see, impacting engagement and bias.
- Competition: Competes with original publishers for attention but can drive traffic to them.
