## Intermediate Role

- Bridging firms with universities
- Most of its R&D institutes are located in universities
- Directors of these institutes mostly have professor titles.
- Most came from universities, while some were from industry (and later appointed as professors)
- Undergraduate students start working as research assistants and continue working during their Master's degree and Ph.D. After graduation, they can work for 3-5 years before leaving for the industry.
