| **Metric** | **Description** | **Tools** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Impact Factor (IF)** | Measures the average number of citations received in a particular year by articles published in the journal during the previous two years. | Journal Citation Reports (JCR) |
| **h-index** | An author-level metric that measures both the productivity and citation impact of a journal's published articles. | Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science |
| **Eigenfactor Score** | Measures the total influence of a journal by considering the number of citations and the quality of citing journals, over a five-year period. | [Eigenfactor.org](http://eigenfactor.org/) |
| **Article Influence Score** | Calculates the average influence of each of a journal’s articles over the first five years after publication. | Journal Citation Reports (JCR) |
| **CiteScore** | Measures the average citations per document received in a four-year period. | Scopus |
| **SCImago Journal Rank (SJR)** | Considers both the number of citations received by a journal and the prestige of the journals where such citations come from. | SCImago (based on Scopus data) |
| **Acceptance Rate** | The percentage of submitted manuscripts that are accepted for publication in the journal. | Journal publishers, directories |
| **Turnaround Time** | The average time taken from submission to decision (peer review) or from acceptance to publication. | Journal publishers, author feedback |
| **Altmetric Score** | Measures online attention and engagement with a journal article (social media, news outlets, policy documents). | [Altmetric.com](http://altmetric.com/) |
| **Cited Half-Life** | The median age of articles cited in a particular journal. | Journal Citation Reports (JCR) |
| **Download Count** | The number of times articles from the journal have been downloaded. | Publisher platforms, Google Scholar |
| **Open Access Percentage** | Percentage of articles in the journal that are freely accessible to the public. | Publisher platforms, DOAJ |
| **International Diversity** | The geographic diversity of authors, reviewers, or editorial board members associated with the journal. | Publisher platforms, author affiliations |
| **Self-Citation Rate** | The percentage of citations a journal receives from its own previously published articles. | Journal Citation Reports (JCR) |

## DOI System Model

> The **DOI (Digital Object Identifier)** System Model is a framework for assigning, managing, and resolving persistent and unique identifiers to digital content, enabling reliable referencing and access across the internet.
> 

> **Naming scheme** uses a unique prefix assigned to a registrant and a suffix chosen by the registrant to create a globally unique identifier for digital resources. The combination of the prefix and suffix forms a globally unique DOI (e.g., `10.1000/xyz123`), where "10" indicates the DOI namespace.
