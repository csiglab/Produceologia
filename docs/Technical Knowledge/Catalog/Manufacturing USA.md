### 1. **Public-Private Partnerships**:

- Manufacturing USA operates as a **network of institutes** formed through collaboration between the government, industry, and academia. Each institute focuses on a specific area of advanced manufacturing, with the goal of fostering innovation and addressing challenges across various sectors.

### 2. **Focus on Advanced Manufacturing**:

- The network emphasizes **advanced manufacturing technologies** such as robotics, advanced materials, digital manufacturing, and biomanufacturing. These cutting-edge technologies are seen as essential for maintaining the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing globally.

### 3. **Institute-Led Research**:

- Each institute is responsible for **leading research** and development in its respective focus area, addressing critical gaps in technology and knowledge. The goal is to accelerate innovation and bring new manufacturing technologies from the research phase to practical application.

### 4. **Workforce Development**:

- A key aspect of the model is the **development of a skilled workforce** for advanced manufacturing. The institutes work with educational institutions to train the next generation of workers and reskill the current workforce, ensuring that they are prepared for the demands of modern manufacturing.

### 5. **Collaborative Innovation**:

- The institutes foster **collaborative environments** where industry, academia, and government stakeholders can work together. This helps reduce the barriers between research and commercialization, facilitating the transition of new technologies from the lab to the factory floor.

### 6. **Federal Funding with Industry Investment**:

- While the federal government provides **seed funding** to establish the institutes, the model relies on significant **industry investment** to ensure that research remains relevant to market needs and that technologies can be commercialized.

### 7. **Regional Economic Development**:

- Each institute is designed to support **regional economic development** by fostering local innovation ecosystems. This helps create jobs, attract investment, and support the growth of manufacturing in specific regions across the U.S.

### 8. **Technology Roadmaps**:

- The network develops **technology roadmaps** that outline the critical technologies and skills required to advance specific manufacturing sectors. These roadmaps guide the research and development activities of the institutes, aligning efforts with the needs of the industry.

### 9. **National Impact**:

- Manufacturing USA aims to have a **national impact** by strengthening U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, reducing reliance on foreign supply chains, and driving economic growth through innovation and advanced manufacturing.

### 10. **Sustainability and Future Focus**:

- The model places a strong emphasis on **sustainable manufacturing** practices and preparing for future challenges, such as the transition to renewable energy, automation, and digital manufacturing systems.
