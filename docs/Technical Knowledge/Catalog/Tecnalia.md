## Room for Improvement

Yes, **Tecnalia**, like any large R\&D organization, can be improved. Below are **strategic and structural improvement areas** that would enhance its impact, efficiency, and global competitiveness:

### üîç 1. **Sharpen Strategic Focus**

* **Current Challenge**: Wide scope of activities can dilute impact and reduce clarity for stakeholders.
* **Improvement**: Define sharper technological "bets" in fewer high-impact areas (e.g., industrial decarbonization, autonomous systems, AI + manufacturing).
* **Benefit**: Stronger brand identity, clearer value proposition, better resource allocation.

### üöÄ 2. **Accelerate Technology-to-Market Pathways**

* **Current Challenge**: Like many research institutions, tech transfer can be slow and fragmented.
* **Improvement**:

  * Streamline the pipeline from lab to market.
  * Foster tighter industry-research integration (e.g., embedded researchers, industry co-ownership).
  * Empower **Tecnalia Ventures** with more risk capital and autonomy.
* **Benefit**: Faster commercialization, more successful spin-offs, higher ROI from R\&D.

### üåç 3. **Strengthen Global Positioning**

* **Current Challenge**: Strong European presence but limited visibility in Asia, the US, and Africa.
* **Improvement**:

  * Form alliances with top global research institutes and tech hubs.
  * Attract foreign industrial clients and talent.
  * Position as a **global deep-tech incubator**, not just a Spanish/EU RTO.
* **Benefit**: Increased prestige, funding diversification, and strategic influence.

### üß† 4. **Reinforce Talent Strategy**

* **Current Challenge**: High competition for top researchers and technologists.
* **Improvement**:

  * Create elite research tracks with global recruitment.
  * Introduce entrepreneurial sabbaticals or intrapreneurship tracks.
  * Use equity or revenue-sharing models in spin-offs to retain innovators.
* **Benefit**: Higher talent retention and performance, stronger internal innovation.

### üìä 5. **Enhance Impact Measurement**

* **Current Challenge**: Outputs often measured by project completion or IP, not real-world impact.
* **Improvement**:

  * Use **outcome-based metrics**: economic impact on client firms, sustainability KPIs, jobs created through spin-offs.
  * Publish **annual impact reports** with sector-specific case studies.
* **Benefit**: Improved accountability, clearer societal contribution, better funding cases.

### üï∏ 6. **Modernize Internal Collaboration Tools**

* **Current Challenge**: Silos between research groups or units.
* **Improvement**:

  * Adopt **knowledge graphs** or internal "talent maps" for cross-pollination.
  * Use AI-driven project matching to link researchers with complementary skills.
* **Benefit**: More innovation from interdisciplinary teams, fewer redundant efforts.
