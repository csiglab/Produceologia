> The **Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)** is a leading non-profit R&D organization in **Taiwan** dedicated to advancing **industrial technology**, fostering **innovation**, and promoting sustainable **economic growth**.
> 

## **Evolution of Roles**

> Adjust and co-evolve with he country development level; reflect the larger change in the country technology mastery;  and move to more advance and under-serve purposes.
> 

| **Time** | **Role** |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1970-early 1980 |  It only has basic operations capabilities but **no design** and **engineering capabilities**—it has insufficient absorptive capacity. | We acquire foreign technology through licensing, then carry out **R&D** to understand, assimilate, and adopt such technology. Finally, we set up new companies through spin-offs. | I was **spinning off** to create startups such as **UMC** and **TSMC**, which later became world-class companies. |
| 1980- early 1990 | Gaining **design** and **engineering** capabilities. | She acted as an intermediary to establish an **R&D consortium** with local companies. The consortium conducted joint research, leading to prototypes, which each participating firm further developed into commercial products. She strengthened firms' R&D capability and R&D management and encouraged start-ups. | **R&D** consortia such as **R&D** consortia of **notebook** producers and **R&D** consortia of **HDTV** producers. |
| late 1990-present | Having **R&D capabilities**. Emerging of **techno-pronouns** interested in setting up new **technologies-based** firms | Strengthening **R&D** capability and R&D management of firms. Encouraging **start-ups**. | **‘Open Lab’** allows **SMEs** to use **incubators** to nurture start-ups. |

## Intermediate Role

- HR mobility is a critical **informal** mode of interaction
- 24,000 ITRI employees left ITRI and brought their talent into the industrial field in 30 years
- Some came back and forth a few times between ITRI and the industry
- 5,000 former ITRI employees are now working for private companies in Hsinchu Park.
