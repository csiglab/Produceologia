> A **laboratory** is a controlled environment equipped with specialized equipment and facilities where scientific research, experiments, and measurements are conducted to advance knowledge in various fields.
> 

> A lab is a set of research groups.
> 

> A **research group** is a collaborative team of scientists and researchers working together on specific scientific inquiries, projects, or programs within a lab, often led by a principal investigator and sharing common goals and resources.
> 

## **Research Group**

> Here's a table summarizing the typical roles found in a research group, along with their responsibilities:
> 

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Principal Investigator (PI)** | Leads the research group, secures funding, defines research direction, oversees projects, mentors team members | Often, a senior faculty member or experienced researcher |
| **Researcher SR** | Conducts advanced research, designs experiments, analyzes data, mentors graduate students, writes papers | Typically holds a PhD and is gaining additional research experience |
| **Researcher JR** | Conducts research as part of their thesis/dissertation, collects and analyzes data, presents findings | Pursuing a master's or doctoral degree |
| **Research Technician** | Supports lab operations, maintains equipment, prepares reagents, assists with experiments | May have a bachelor's or master's degree |
| **Research Apprentice** | Assists with research projects, performs basic experiments, data entry, and literature reviews | Gaining research experience as part of their education |
| **Lab Manager** | Manages day-to-day lab operations, ensures compliance with safety regulations, and orders supplies. | May also assist with research activities |
| **Collaborator** | Provides specialized expertise, participates in joint research projects, co-authors publications | May be from different institutions or disciplines |
