> One of the biggest factors in relation to the jet engines is the metallurgy and casting processes of the first foil turbine blades, the strength to weigh ratios of this component are balanced on a razor's edge and this is where the higher efficiency and reliability of US produced components exceeds the ability of foreign supply chains to manufacture. The key alloys are secretive in both the formulation and foundry processes but the general description is a nickel chromium alloy that is made by Alcoa in a secure facility in Dover new Jersey. There is a building where the alloy billets are made then the material moves in locked shielded boxes to the experimental foundry where the ceramic molds from the cold side are poured with the proprietary metal alloy. The main bottle neck is the torsion delamination threshold found in the stresses that act on these parts as the speed of the airframe increases. This super alloy as its known has much higher performance than any other competitor products. Hope this helps and narrows your focus to the lynchpin components of advanced jet engines.
