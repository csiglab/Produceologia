- Hydro Technology:  **Hydro technology** refers to the application of scientific and engineering principles to harness, control, and manage water resources through systems and devices for purposes such as energy generation, irrigation, water supply, flood control, and environmental management.

### ðŸŒŠ **Hydro Technology Overview**

| **Domain** | **Technology** | **Primary Function** | **Examples / Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Water Power** | **Hydropower Systems** | Convert kinetic/potential energy of water into electricity | Dams, run-of-river plants, micro-hydro systems |
|  | **Pumped-storage Hydropower** | Grid energy storage via water elevation cycling | Acts like a battery for the electric grid |
| **Irrigation & Agriculture** | **Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation** | Efficient water delivery to crops | Reduces water loss via evaporation |
|  | **Canal Automation** | Flow control in irrigation canals | SCADA-integrated sluice gates |
| **Water Supply** | **Pumping Systems** | Move water from source to users | Centrifugal, submersible, or jet pumps |
|  | **Desalination Technologies** | Convert seawater to freshwater | Reverse osmosis, electrodialysis |
| **Wastewater & Treatment** | **Water Treatment Plants** | Remove contaminants from water | Filtration, UV treatment, activated sludge |
|  | **Greywater Recycling Systems** | Reuse domestic wastewater | For toilets, gardens, etc. |
| **Flood & Flow Control** | **Flood Barriers & Retention Systems** | Prevent or manage overflow | Levees, retention basins, smart gates |
|  | **Stormwater Management Systems** | Control runoff in urban areas | Permeable pavements, bioswales |
| **Hydraulic Engineering** | **Hydraulic Structures** | Control or direct water flow | Dams, spillways, weirs, culverts |
