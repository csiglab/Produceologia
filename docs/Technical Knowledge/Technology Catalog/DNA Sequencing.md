**Technologies Powering DNA Sequencing Machines**

| **Technology** | **Description** | **Role in DNA Sequencing** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Biochemical Reactions** | Enzymatic processes that replicate or amplify DNA. | - **Sanger Sequencing**: Uses DNA polymerase to synthesize DNA strands. <br> - **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)**: Relies on DNA polymerase for amplification and sequencing-by-synthesis. |
| **Fluorescent Labeling** | Uses fluorescent dyes to tag nucleotides or DNA fragments. | - Detects the order of nucleotides during sequencing. <br> - Each nucleotide (A, T, C, G) is labeled with a unique fluorescent marker. |
| **Optical Detection Systems** | High-resolution cameras and lasers to detect fluorescent signals. | - Captures fluorescence emitted by labeled nucleotides. <br> - Converts optical signals into digital data for analysis. |
| **Microfluidics** | Miniaturized fluid-handling systems for precise control of reagents and samples. | - Enables high-throughput sequencing by processing multiple samples simultaneously. <br> - Reduces reagent consumption and improves efficiency. |
| **Nanopore Technology** | Uses nanopores to detect DNA sequences as they pass through tiny pores. | - **Oxford Nanopore Sequencing**: Measures changes in electrical current as DNA strands pass through a nanopore. |
| **Capillary Electrophoresis** | Separates DNA fragments by size using an electric field. | - Used in **Sanger Sequencing** to separate fluorescently labeled DNA fragments. |
| **Sequencing-by-Synthesis (SBS)** | A method where DNA is synthesized one nucleotide at a time. | - **Illumina Sequencing**: Uses reversible terminators to add one nucleotide at a time, with fluorescence detection after each addition. |
| **Pyrosequencing** | Detects nucleotide incorporation by measuring light emitted during the reaction. | - **Roche 454 Sequencing**: Measures pyrophosphate release during DNA synthesis. |
| **Ion Semiconductor Sequencing** | Detects hydrogen ions released during DNA synthesis. | - **Ion Torrent Sequencing**: Measures pH changes as nucleotides are incorporated into the DNA strand. |
| **Computational Algorithms** | Software for data analysis, base calling, and error correction. | - Converts raw optical or electrical signals into DNA sequences. <br> - Aligns sequences to reference genomes and identifies variants. |
| **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** | Powerful computers for processing large sequencing datasets. | - Handles massive amounts of sequencing data (e.g., whole-genome sequencing). <br> - Enables real-time data analysis. |
| **Automation and Robotics** | Automated systems for sample preparation and sequencing workflows. | - Reduces human error and increases throughput. <br> - Handles repetitive tasks like pipetting and plate loading. |
| **Chip-Based Sequencing** | Uses microchips to perform sequencing reactions. | - **Illumina**: Uses flow cells with immobilized DNA fragments. <br> - **Ion Torrent**: Uses semiconductor chips for ion detection. |
| **CRISPR-Based Sequencing** | Uses CRISPR-Cas systems to target specific DNA regions for sequencing. | - Enables targeted sequencing of specific genomic regions. |
| **Single-Molecule Sequencing** | Sequences individual DNA molecules without amplification. | - **PacBio SMRT Sequencing**: Detects DNA synthesis in real-time using zero-mode waveguides. <br> - **Oxford Nanopore**: Sequences DNA directly as it passes through a nanopore. |
