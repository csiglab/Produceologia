| **PCR Technology** | **Principle** | **Applications** | **Key Features** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Conventional PCR** | Amplifies DNA using a pair of primers and a DNA polymerase enzyme. | Gene cloning, genotyping, mutation detection. | Basic PCR method; requires post-amplification analysis (e.g., gel electrophoresis). |
| **Real-Time PCR (qPCR)** | Quantifies DNA amplification in real-time using fluorescent dyes or probes. | Gene expression analysis, pathogen detection, quantification of DNA/RNA. | High sensitivity, quantitative results, no post-amplification processing needed. |
| **Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR)** | Converts RNA into cDNA, followed by PCR amplification. | Gene expression analysis, RNA virus detection. | Enables amplification of RNA targets. |
| **Digital PCR (dPCR)** | Partitions the sample into thousands of individual reactions for absolute quantification. | Rare mutation detection, copy number variation analysis, absolute quantification. | High precision, absolute quantification without standard curves. |
| **Nested PCR** | Uses two sets of primers to improve specificity and sensitivity. | Detection of low-abundance targets, reducing non-specific amplification. | Reduces contamination risks and improves specificity. |
| **Multiplex PCR** | Amplifies multiple targets simultaneously using multiple primer pairs. | Pathogen detection, genetic screening, forensic analysis. | Saves time and reagents; detects multiple targets in one reaction. |
| **Hot Start PCR** | Uses modified DNA polymerase or antibodies to prevent non-specific amplification at low temperatures. | High-specificity applications, reducing primer-dimer formation. | Improves specificity and yield by preventing early amplification. |
| **Touchdown PCR** | Gradually reduces the annealing temperature to increase specificity. | Amplification of difficult templates, reducing non-specific products. | Enhances specificity by optimizing primer binding. |
| **Asymmetric PCR** | Amplifies one strand of DNA preferentially to produce single-stranded DNA. | Sequencing, probe generation, hybridization assays. | Generates single-stranded DNA for downstream applications. |
| **Inverse PCR** | Amplifies DNA with unknown sequences flanking a known region. | Genome walking, identification of insertion sites, cloning of unknown sequences. | Useful for studying regions adjacent to known sequences. |
| **Overlap Extension PCR** | Joins multiple DNA fragments by overlapping primers. | Gene splicing, site-directed mutagenesis, chimeric gene construction. | Enables assembly of large DNA constructs. |
| **Colony PCR** | Amplifies DNA directly from bacterial colonies. | Screening recombinant clones, verifying plasmid inserts. | Rapid screening without DNA extraction. |
| **Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP)** | Detects methylated DNA using primers specific to methylated or unmethylated sequences. | Epigenetic studies, cancer research, methylation profiling. | Distinguishes between methylated and unmethylated DNA. |
| **Allele-Specific PCR** | Uses primers specific to particular alleles to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). | Genotyping, SNP detection, genetic disease diagnosis. | High specificity for allele discrimination. |
| **Long-Range PCR** | Amplifies long DNA fragments using specialized DNA polymerases. | Genome sequencing, large gene amplification, structural variant analysis. | Capable of amplifying fragments up to 40 kb or more. |
| **Isothermal PCR** | Amplifies DNA at a constant temperature without thermal cycling. | Point-of-care diagnostics, field applications. | Eliminates the need for a thermal cycler; rapid and portable. |
