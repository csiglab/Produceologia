| **Printing Technology** | **Description** | **Primary Applications** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Offset Lithography** | Uses plates to transfer ink onto a rubber blanket, then onto the printing surface (typically paper). | Magazines, books, brochures, newspapers, and packaging. |
| **Digital Printing** | Directly prints from digital files, without needing plates. | Short-run jobs, business cards, posters, and labels. |
| **Inkjet Printing** | Sprays droplets of ink onto paper or other materials. | Posters, banners, labels, home printing, and textiles. |
| **Laser Printing** | Uses a laser beam to produce high-resolution text and images by fusing toner onto paper. | Office documents, labels, and small-scale production. |
| **Flexography** | Uses flexible rubber plates and fast-drying inks. Suitable for non-flat surfaces. | Packaging, labels, plastic bags, and newspapers. |
| **Screen Printing** | Forces ink through a mesh stencil onto the substrate. | T-shirts, textiles, posters, and promotional items. |
| **Gravure Printing** | Uses engraved cylinders to transfer ink, especially for high-volume printing. | Magazines, stamps, wallpaper, and packaging. |
| **Pad Printing** | Transfers ink from a silicone pad to irregularly shaped surfaces. | Promotional items, electronics, and medical devices. |
| **Thermal Printing** | Uses heat-sensitive media or ribbon to produce an image. | Receipts, labels, barcodes, and ID cards. |
| **3D Printing (Additive)** | Builds objects layer by layer from materials like plastic, resin, or metal. | Prototyping, manufacturing, medical implants, and models. |
| **Dye Sublimation** | Uses heat to transfer dye onto materials, especially polyester. | Apparel, photo printing, and custom merchandise. |
| **Letterpress** | An older relief printing process that presses raised type onto paper. | Wedding invitations, stationery, and art prints. |
| **Rotogravure** | Similar to gravure but optimized for high-speed, high-volume jobs. | Packaging, magazines, and gift wrap. |
| **Photographic Printing** | Traditional process using photosensitive chemicals and light exposure. | Film photography, fine art, and archival prints. |
| **Electrostatic Printing** | Uses electrically charged toner particles to create images. | Office copiers and low- to medium-volume document printing. |
