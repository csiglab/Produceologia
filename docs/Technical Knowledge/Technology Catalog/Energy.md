Here's the table of electricity generation costs by source, ordered by **cost per megawatt-hour (MWh)**, from lowest to highest:

| **Energy Source** | **Cost (USD/MWh)** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Onshore Wind** | $27–$73 | Low operational costs, varies by region. |
| **Solar PV** | $29–$92 | Highly competitive; cost continues to decline. |
| **Hydropower** | $50–$100 | Affordable but limited by geography and capacity. |
| **Biomass** | $50–$120 | Depends on feedstock and technology. |
| **Natural Gas (CCGT)** | $45–$108 | Efficient for baseload and peak demand. |
| **Geothermal** | $64–$106 | Efficient but location-dependent. |
| **Coal** | $69–$168 | Declining due to environmental concerns. |
| **Offshore Wind** | $74–$139 | Higher cost due to complex infrastructure. |
| **Gas Peaking Plants** | $110–$228 | Used for short-term peak demand, higher cost. |
| **Oil-Fired Power** | $150–$250 | Used for backup or remote locations, high fuel cost. |
| **Nuclear** | $142–$227 | High initial costs but stable long-term output. |
| **Wave and Tidal Energy** | $120–$300 | Emerging technology, limited commercial deployment. |
