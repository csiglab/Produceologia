## Light

The **function of light in display devices** is to **make the content visible to the viewer**. Depending on the type of display technology, light can be used in different ways:

| **Display Type** | **Light Source** | **Function of Light** | **Examples** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Emissive Displays** | **Self-Emitting** | Light is generated directly by the display pixels to create images. | OLED, LED, MicroLED, Plasma Displays. |
| **Non-Emissive Displays** | **External Light Modulation** | Light from an external source (e.g., backlight or ambient light) is modulated to create images. | LCD (with backlight), E Ink (reflects ambient light). |
| **Projection Displays** | **Projected Light** | Light is projected onto a surface (e.g., screen) to form an image. | DLP (Digital Light Processing), LCoS (Liquid Crystal on Silicon). |
