## Goals

> Technology labs, especially those focused on research and development (R&D), often have various goals and objectives.
> 

Here's a list of common types of plans for technology labs:

1. **Technology Transfer / Diffusion:** Facilitate technology transfer from the lab to practical industry applications, promoting commercialization.
2. **Technology Absorption / Reverse Engineering:** …
3. **Prepare /Train High-Quality Researchers**: …
4. **Product Development:** Engage in developing new products, technologies, or prototypes based on research findings.
5. **Collaboration and Partnerships:** Establish collaborations with industry, academia, and other research institutions to leverage collective expertise.
6. **Commercialization:** Focus on translating research outcomes into marketable products or services that positively impact the economy.
7. **Open Innovation:** Embrace open innovation practices, including collaboration with external partners and open-source initiatives.
8. **Technology Standards and Regulations:** Contribute to establishing standards and regulations for emerging technologies.
9. **Digital Transformation:** Contribute to the digital transformation of industries by developing technologies that leverage digital capabilities.
10. **Adaptation:** Foster a continuous learning and adaptation culture to stay abreast of emerging technologies and trends.

These goals are not mutually exclusive, and many technology labs pursue a combination of them to achieve holistic and impactful outcomes. The specific goals of a technology lab may vary based on its focus areas, mission, and the affiliated organization's or institution's broader objectives.

|  | **Birth Year** | **Revenues** | **Number of Employees** | Role | Funding (public/private) | Interaction/Business Model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Fraunhofer (Germany)** | 1949 | 2.5 billion | 22,000 | Industry needs, long-term **R&D**, internationalization. | 35%,65% | **Contract Research** and **people mobility**,  bridging industry and university. |
| CSIRO (Australia) | 1916 | 1 billion | 5,200 | Moving from **basic research** organization to **innovation catalyst** of the country. Still **struggling**. | 80%,20% | Contract research, follow by licenging.  |
| AIST (Japon) | 1948 | 1 billion | 2,900 | **Long-term R&D** to **create new industries**, pr**imary research** (lately go back to apply research) | 75%,25% | Licencing, contract research, **consortium** |
| NIST (USA) | 1901 | 1 billion | 3,000 | Focus on **basic research** on measurement  and standards with unrelated activities to support the industry, especially **SMEs** | 100%:0% | **Large science facilities**. Local networks building for SMEs. **R&D Consortium**. |
| **ITRI (Taiwan)** | 1973 | 0.5 billion | 5,800 | **Co-evolution with NIS**. Always focusing on SMEs. I was moved to **research on next-generation technologies** that were too **risky/out** of the scope of existing firms. | 35%:65% | Contract research, people mobility, **spin off**, R&D consortium, and later, incubating, licensing, **spin in**, and venture creation. |

## Hiring Models

- **Permanent**: Deepend knowledge of the reorganization; conduct long-term R&D
- **Limited-term Contracted**: Help mobility and knowledge transfer in/out; help to build trust and connections.
- **Salaries**:
