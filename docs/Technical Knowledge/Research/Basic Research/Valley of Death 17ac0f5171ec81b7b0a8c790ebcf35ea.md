# Valley of Death

> The "valley of death" in innovation refers to the critical and often perilous phase between research and development (R&D) and the commercialization of a new technology or product. During this phase, many innovations fail to progress due to insufficient funding, lack of market readiness, technical challenges, or inadequate support structures. It is characterized by high risk and uncertainty, making it difficult for innovations to transition from promising concepts to marketable products.
