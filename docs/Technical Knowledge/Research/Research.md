### Industrial Research Lab

→ Industrial Research Lab works with universities and enterprise product team.

→ The most fundamental; the closet the research should be to universities or similar institutions.

Erik Meijer, ..., said that he was “never a fan” of research divisions inside companies like Meta.

“If companies want to do fundamental research, they should give money with no strings attached to universities,” he said. “Industrial labs should work closely with the product teams to create a pipeline of future innovations via a tight feedback loop between production and research.”

To be blunt, he said, “I think it is great if FAIR disappears and that Meta is putting, to borrow a Google saying, ‘More wood behind fewer arrows.’” He was referring to former Google CEO Larry Page’s use of the expression to describe the company’s strategy of focusing its resources on a few core projects. ...

> **Technology Absorption** refers to the process by which an  entity (e.g., firm, nation, or industry) acquires, assimilates, adapts,  and ultimately deploys externally sourced technological knowledge to  enhance its own productive capabilities, often involving incremental  innovation, workforce upskilling, and institutional adaptation to 
achieve sustained competitive advantage.
> 
1. **Replication** (Ability to reproduce the technology) *Example:* Reverse-engineering a machine to build a local version.
2. **Improvement** (Incremental innovation) *Example:* Modifying an imported manufacturing process for higher efficiency.
3. **Assimilation** (Deep understanding of underlying principles) *Example:* Engineers mastering the science behind a foreign semiconductor design.
4. **Diffusion** (Spreading knowledge across the industry/society) *Example:* Training programs to scale up skilled labor for new tech.

**Example:**

- **China’s high-speed rail**: Initially imported German/Japanese trains → **absorbed** tech by localizing production, improving designs, and building a domestic supply chain.
- **Some African phone assembly plants**: Merely assemble imported parts without mastering chip design → **no real absorption**.

> **Technology Adoption (The name upgrading can also be used):**  Technology Adoption (or Upgrading) refers to the decision-making process and implementation phase wherein an entity (individual, firm, or nation) acquires and deploys an existing technology without necessarily internalizing its underlying knowledge or achieving independent adaptive capacity.

- **Groupthink**: Research trends can become narrow, discouraging alternative or radical ideas.
- **Career Bottlenecks**: Postdocs and researchers may face fewer permanent jobs, leading to a "pyramid" structure.
- **Political Pressure**: Governments or sponsors may influence research agendas, leading to biased outcomes.
- **[You Can Fix This With Different Type of Objectives & Clear Mision] Commercialization Pressure**: Focus on patents and industry partnerships may reduce pure/basic research.
- **Short-Termism**: Funding cycles force researchers to chase trendy topics instead of important long-term questions.

Financial Independence:

> Labs should not manage a fund directly; that activity should be terciarity.
> 
- **Public Funding**: Maintain traditional government grants and subsidies for foundational research or public missions.
- **Private Investment**: Venture capital, private equity, or partnerships with industry players, especially for applied or commercial research.
- **Self-Generated Revenue**: Generate income from services, intellectual property (IP) licensing, or even an investment portfolio.

**Characterization:**

- **Bureaucracy and Inertia**: Large research systems often become slow, with administrative overhead choking innovation.
- **Funding Inequality**: Centralized centers may monopolize funding, starving smaller or more experimental research efforts.
- **Groupthink**: Research trends can become narrow, discouraging alternative or radical ideas.
- **Career Bottlenecks**: Postdocs and researchers may face fewer permanent jobs, leading to a "pyramid" structure.
- **Political Pressure**: Governments or sponsors may influence research agendas, leading to biased outcomes.
- **Regional Inequality**: Areas without major centers fall behind economically and scientifically.
- **Commercialization Pressure**: Focus on patents and industry partnerships may reduce pure/basic research.

Internal Innovation Equity:

- [ ]  When a researcher develops a bold idea inside the organization (even during sandbox projects), they get "innovation shares" — rights to a part of future royalties, licenses, or spin-off value.
- [ ]  Innovation Review Board: Independent, elite panel evaluates and validates ideas for internal funding and stock-option grants.
- [ ]  Bold Researcher Incentives: Financial rewards for taking risks — if their project succeeds, they get payouts tied to impact (spin-offs, patents, public benefit).
- [ ]  Spin-off Labs Program: 	Researchers with strong ideas can "graduate" into spinning off micro-labs or startups with backing from the center. The center retains some equity, but the researchers become partial owners.
- [ ]  Fail-Safe Clause: Failed bold projects don't hurt career progression. Researchers are encouraged to attempt high-risk projects without fear.
- [ ]  Independent Financial Researchers:  Bring in dedicated finance/innovation officers who specialize in supporting researchers through the spin-out, licensing, or venture creation process. Not bureaucrats — entrepreneurial experts.

> How TNO  manages competition?  TNO often acts as a **neutral third party** to manage competing companies' joint research.
> 

> Balances **strategic research** (long-term benefit) with **contract research** (short-term solutions)
> 

**Collaboration Model**

- Always in **networks**:
    - Industry consortia
    - University collaborations
    - Public sector alliances
- TNO often acts as a **neutral third party** to manage competing companies' joint research.

**Internal Structure:**

Organized into **units** (used to be called "departments" or "clusters"):

- Each unit is **semi-autonomous**, like a mini research business.
- Units develop their own strategy, budget, client portfolio.
- Central board oversees the overall mission and quality.

**Intellectual Property**

- TNO creates patents but **licenses them** rather than manufacturing products.
- Sometimes spins off start-ups if there’s commercial potential.

International Collaboration:

- Make sure that at least 20% of the personal is International?
- Partner **deeply** with Wageningen University, UC Davis, CGIAR centers.
- Open offices in Netherlands, California, and Singapore for tech scouting.
- Join international research projects (instead of only domestic).

## ❌ MARDI (Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute)

> A Terrible Example.
> 

> Note: Very Old Research Agenda.
> 

> MARDI is trapped: too bureaucratic, too outdated, too slow, too disconnected from farmers, industry, and the world.
> 

> Mixes research with to many activities like “training”;   low technology transfers;  problems with programs (usually not high tech; focus on old methods & goals);  research domains;  no industry aligment;
> 

> |If Malaysia copies Embrapa blindly (old model) | 🚫 Will fall behind within 10 years. | | If Malaysia builds an Embrapa-core + AI/IoT/Robotics precision layer | 🚀 Will leapfrog into global leadership in tropical agri-tech.|

Why **Split Pilot Plants** and Farmer Training From **Research**? 

- Researchers are great at discovery — developing tech, prototypes, new seeds, algorithms.
- But scaling and training needs **different expertise**: logistics, adult education, field management, marketing.
- Mixing them slows down both sides.

Wageningen model:

- University develops tech → government extension services and private firms scale it.
- …

Today, if you want to model it practically,

you **mix** parts of:

- 🧪 *Wageningen-style world-class research*
- 🌱 *US Extension-style farmer networks*
- 🏭 *Israeli-style commercial-ready pilot farms and startups*

**→ into one coherent ecosystem.**

- Broad Institute (USA)
- National Institutes of Health (NIH, USA)
- Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI, USA)

Core Principles:

- **Small is Beautiful Inside** → Break CNRS into smaller, semi-autonomous research "cells."
- **Empowered Labs** → Push budget, hiring, and research decisions to the lab level.
- **Fast Central Coordination** → Central CNRS HQ only handles strategy, compliance, external partnerships.
- **Data-Driven Management** → Track decision speed, project outcomes, researcher satisfaction.

Central CNRS Office:

- Small HQ: ~200 people (not 2,000+)
- Roles:
    - Strategy: Big goals and funding frameworks
    - Compliance: Ethics, finance auditing
    - Partnerships: with government, industry, international bodies
    - Mobility: Make researcher movement across labs super easy
- No micro-managing of research content.

Clusters:

- Thematic clusters (e.g., Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Social Sciences)
- Each cluster is light-touch: coordination role only.
- Help labs collaborate but **don't impose heavy top-down agendas**.

Autonomous Labs ("Research Cells")

- Each lab (~30–200 people) runs like a mini-startup:
    - Own internal budget
    - Power to hire quickly
    - Freedom to choose research directions (aligned with CNRS mission)
    - 3-year lightweight performance reviews (not annual suffocating reviews)
- Labs compete lightly for special innovation funds.
- Labs encouraged to form **multi-lab collaborations** horizontally (not vertically enforced).

Express Funding Tracks

- For fast innovation:
    - Idea → 2 pages → decision within 1 month.
    - Pilot projects (~€50k–€500k) can be awarded instantly.
- No endless forms, no 12 months waiting.

Tech-Enabled Admin

- Researcher dashboard: Admin tasks (hiring, reporting) done through a user-friendly internal app.
- Bureaucracy KPIs tracked:
    
    (e.g., "Hiring Time," "Funding Approval Time") → optimize to minimize.
    

Talent Mobility and Growth

- Easy internal moves: Researchers can move between labs/clusters without killing their careers.
- Career paths: Research, teaching, entrepreneurship — flexibility to move between.
- Dedicated support for young researchers (startup funds, fast hiring, mentorship).

Researcher "Nodes"

- Every researcher is registered in a CNRS 3.0 global platform.
- They have profiles:
    - Skills, interests, past project outcomes, peer endorsements.
- Algorithms + social choice (human voting) match researchers to projects in real-time.

Transparent Reputation System

- Reputation points based on:
    - Quality of research outputs
    - Peer reviews
    - Societal impact of projects
- Reputation boosts access to leadership roles, better funding, and mission design rights.
