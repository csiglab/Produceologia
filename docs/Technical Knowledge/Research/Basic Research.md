# Basic Research

> **Basic research** is the systematic study and investigation conducted to expand fundamental knowledge and understanding of the underlying principles of a phenomenon, without immediate practical application in mind.

## Organization Models

1. **University-Based Research Centers**: Many universities have dedicated centers or institutes focused on specific disciplines or interdisciplinary areas where basic research is conducted.
2. **Government Research Agencies**: National research agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States or the National Science Foundation (NSF), often organize and fund basic research in various fields.
3. **Independent Research Institutes**: These are organizations solely dedicated to research, such as the Max Planck Institute or the Scripps Research Institute, where basic research is a primary focus.
4. **Corporate Research and Development (R&D) Labs**: Large corporations often have R&D divisions or labs where basic research is conducted to drive innovation and develop new technologies or products.
5. **International Collaborative Research Consortia**: Consortia or partnerships between multiple organizations, both public and private, can be formed to conduct collaborative basic research on a global scale.
6. **Nonprofit Research Organizations**: Nonprofit entities like the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) or the Wellcome Trust fund conduct basic research in various scientific areas.

## Research Center Organization Models

Here are several organizational models commonly found in research centers:

1. **Matrix Structure**: Research centers often adopt a matrix structure where teams are organized by function (e.g., research area or discipline) and project. This allows for interdisciplinary collaboration and efficient resource allocation.
2. **Divisional Structure**: In this model, the research center is divided into distinct divisions or departments based on research areas or disciplines, each with its leadership and resources.
3. **Project-Based Structure**: Research centers may organize themselves around specific projects or research initiatives, with teams formed temporarily to work on these projects before disbanding or reorganizing for new projects.
4. **Network Structure**: Some research centers operate as networks of collaborating institutions within the same country and internationally, pooling resources and expertise to address common research goals.
5. **Hub-and-Spoke Model**: In this model, the research center serves as the central hub coordinating and supporting multiple satellite research units or laboratories, each specializing in different aspects of the center's overall research agenda.
6. **Functional Structure**: Research centers may organize themselves based on specific functions such as administration, research support services, and core facilities, ensuring efficient operation and resource management.
7. **Hybrid Models**: Many research centers combine elements of the above models to create hybrid organizational structures tailored to their specific needs and objectives, such as a matrix structure with project-based teams or a divisional structure with cross-functional working groups.

Each of these organizational models has its advantages and challenges, and the choice of model often depends on factors such as the research center's size, scope, funding sources, and research priorities.

## Research University

> A research university is an institution of higher education where the primary focus is on conducting advanced research across various disciplines while also providing undergraduate and graduate education.
