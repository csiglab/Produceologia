# Research Groups

**"Research Groups"** as **quasi-firms** refer to the concept where research groups within academic institutions or other organizations operate similarly to firms. They exhibit characteristics such as:

1. **Autonomy**: Research groups often have a degree of operational independence, making decisions on research directions, project management, and resource allocation.
2. **Funding and Resources**: Like firms, they compete for funding from various sources, manage budgets, and allocate resources to different projects.
3. **Leadership and Hierarchy**: They typically have a leadership structure with a principal investigator (PI) or group leader who acts similarly to a firm's CEO, making strategic decisions and guiding the group's research agenda.
4. **Outputs and Outcomes**: Their performance is often measured by outputs such as publications, patents, and other research contributions analogous to a firm's products and services.
5. **Collaboration and Competition**: Research groups collaborate with other groups and institutions, but they also compete for funding, talent, and recognition in their field, similar to firms in a market.
6. **Incentives and Rewards**: Members of research groups may be motivated by incentives such as career advancement, recognition, and financial rewards, paralleling the incentive structures in firms.
