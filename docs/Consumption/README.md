###  Which is the different between buyers vs consumer?

> An economic agent that executes the purchase transaction, i.e., transfers payment or consideration in exchange for a good or service.

> An economic agent that uses, experiences, or derives final utility from a good or service, thereby terminating its movement in the value chain.


| Dimension               | Buyer                  | Consumer                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Core role               | Transactional          | Functional              |
| Defining act            | Purchasing             | Using / consuming       |
| Relation to payment     | Pays                   | May or may not pay      |
| Position in value chain | Any position           | Final position          |
| Legal framing           | Contracting party      | Protected end user      |
| Typical protections     | Contract law           | Consumer protection law |
| Example                 | Company buying laptops | Employee using laptops  |

### When we refer to “consumption” in marketing, do we mean buying?

> In marketing, “consumption” does not strictly mean buying, although everyday usage often conflates the two.

> Consumption refers to the use, experience, or appropriation of value from a product or service — not the purchase act itself.

> Marketing often models the sequence: Awareness → Consideration → Purchase → Use → Post-use evaluation.

> Marketing analyzes consumption because value is realized in use, not at checkout.

Marketing focuses on value creation and capture.

From a marketing perspective:

- Value is created by firms
- Value is realized at consumption
- Purchase is merely the access mechanism
