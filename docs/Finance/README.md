# Finance

> Financial Sector: The financial sector comprises the set of institutions, markets, infrastructures, and services responsible for the intermediation, allocation, transformation, and governance of financial resources. It includes banking, investment services, insurance, asset and wealth management, capital markets, payment systems, and financial technology providers. Its core functions are to allocate capital efficiently, manage and redistribute risk, enable liquidity and payment flows, and support economic growth and systemic stability.

> **Finance** is the system through which financial claims (assets, liabilities, and risk exposures) are created, transferred, and reallocated among economic agents.

> **Note**: Finance is placed at the root of the tree because it represents the most abstract set of tools through which surplus value is mobilized, allocated, and transformed.

> Finance functions in economic systems like energy functions in physical systems: an abstract enabling medium that makes all higher-order processes possible through flows, transformations, and intertemporal storage.

## Formulation

> How to think about finance?

In the most abstract, system-level terms, the **function of finance** is:

- **Resource Allocation**: Finance channels resources.
- **Liquidity Provision**: Finance converts illiquid claims into immediately exchangeable purchasing power, enabling agents to enter and exit positions without disrupting underlying economic activity. This includes market-making, payment systems, and maturity transformation.
- **Intertemporal Resource Allocation**:  Finance moves resources **across time**—from periods of surplus to periods of deficit—enabling investment, consumption smoothing, and long-horizon planning.
- **Risk Distribution and Transformation**: Finance redistributes **uncertain future outcomes** across agents according to their capacity, preferences, and incentives, transforming raw risks into tolerable and tradable exposures.
- **Information and Coordination**: Finance provides **signals, prices, and governance mechanisms** that coordinate expectations and decisions among decentralized agents, enabling coherent economic activity under uncertainty.
- **Asset Custody and Safekeeping**: Finance offers institutional mechanisms to hold, protect, administer, and record ownership of assets, including securities, cash, commodities, and digital claims. This function underpins trust, enforceability, and the integrity of property rights in the system.
- **Exchange, Clearing, and Settlement Enablement**: Finance supplies the infrastructures and protocols that allow agents to transfer ownership and discharge obligations securely, reliably, and at scale. This includes payment rails, clearinghouses, custodians, and settlement systems.

## Financial Ecosystem

> The **financial system** is an ecosystem comprising heterogeneous agents, institutions, instruments, and infrastructures that co-evolve through coordinated and competitive interactions to allocate capital, distribute risk, generate liquidity, and enforce financial commitments.

> **Note**: Although the term financial system is widely used, the underlying phenomenon is not a closed or sharply bounded system; rather, it is a continuously evolving ecosystem whose boundaries are porous, overlapping, and endogenously reshaped by institutional change, technological innovation, regulatory shifts, and market behavior.

> What is the structure of the system? The financial system is a multilayered coordination architecture composed of institutions, instruments, infrastructures, markets, and balance-sheet networks that collectively enable the formation, transfer, pricing, and enforcement of financial claims.

> Which are the dynamics of such system? The financial system operates through interdependent flow, state, price, risk, information, institutional, and monetary-credit dynamics that jointly govern how capital, liquidity, risk, and information evolve and propagate over time.

## QA

### What is the relation between the term finantial instrument and finatial assets?

> A **financial instrument** is like the recipe, while the financial asset is the cake you get from following it.

- **Financial asset** is the economic resource/value itself that you hold.
- **Financial instrument** is the contract or legal mechanism that creates or represents that asset.
