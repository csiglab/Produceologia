Interesting Telegram operating details in this interview with founder Pavel Durov:

- ~1 billion users
- Never ran an ad
- Only 30 full-time employees
- He’s the sole director, equity holder and product manager (works directly with every engineer and designer)
- No HR (he recruits people through www.contest dot com, a contest platform that pays cash prizes to solve engineering challenges; people that win a lot are considered “the best of the best of the best” and may get an offer to work with Telegram)

That’s one lean operation (a relevant comparison: WhatsApp had 55 employees and 450m users when it sold to Facebook for $19B in 2014).
