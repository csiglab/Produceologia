# Technical Production

> Note: These entries are part of Arbitriologia.

> In every analysis of production systems, industries, or firms, a Technology Section will be included and cross-referenced with relevant entries from Arbitriologia.

## Formulation

> Technical Object (Constitutive Technique) - Constitutive Technique + Operating Technique → Product(s)

> Note: There can be other types of techniques for specialized technologies. In computing, Representational Techniques.

| **Operative Technique**                        | Methods or procedures applied to transform inputs into outputs. Focuses on the *action* or *operation* itself.                                             | Manufacturing processes, algorithms execution, assembly steps |
| **Constitutive Technique**                     | Principles, methods, or designs that define how a technical object is structured or functions. Focuses on the *structure* or *constitution* of the object. | Gear mechanisms, database schema, electronic circuit design   |
| **Constitutive Technical Object**              | Physical or digital artifact that embodies a constitutive technique.                                                                                       | Engine, software module, conveyor system                      |
| **Production Technical Object (Capital Good)** | Tools, equipment, or infrastructure used to produce other technical objects or products.                                                                   | CNC machine, development environment, robotic arm             |
