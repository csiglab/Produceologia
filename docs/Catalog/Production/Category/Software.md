# Software Technology

> A minimal, structural vocabulary to reason about how software capabilities are built up from foundational operational procedures.

## Formulation

> **Software Technology** consists of the formal description of processes that a machine executes to drive actuators, manipulate data, or control system behavior. It encompasses the design and integration of operational techniques, technical objects, and constitutive principles into deployable products that achieve specific effects in a controlled environment.

## Terminology

> Note: Technical objects are constructed from combinations of other technical objects and the operational techniques that underpin them.

> Note: A Product is also a Technical Object—one that aggregates multiple technical objects and operational techniques into a deployable, externally oriented system. However, in this document we will use the term Product specifically to refer to the final user–facing object.
