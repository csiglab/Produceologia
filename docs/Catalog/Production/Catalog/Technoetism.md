# Technoetism

> Era in which a set of techniques enables the creation of technical objects that resemble the human brain, designed to perform processes across a wide variety of domains.


> Technoetism (sp Tecnoetismo) has roots in the fusion of technology (tecno-/techno-) and the concept of intellect or mind (-et-, from Greek nous, noos, or oētos), combined with -ism to denote a doctrine or worldview. It represents a philosophical and practical orientation toward intelligent systems, brain-inspired computation, and mimetic or imitative mechanisms, framing the study and development of artificial cognition as both a technical and conceptual pursuit.

Guiding Questions:

- How can we characterize the new vanguard of production (Technoetism)?
- Which other names are used for this vanguard? (e.g., Knowledge Economy, …)
- How to integrate 'Smart' Functionality into Classical Software?
- Transformation
     - How can current processes be reformulated using Technoetism?
     - How can existing workflows be upgraded through Technoetist methods?
     - How can Technoetism enable expansion into new problem domains?
- Which questions should I be asking in order to characterize this new era?
