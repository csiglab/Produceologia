# Electronics Technology

> Electronics technology encompasses the study, design, and application of systems and devices that manipulate electrical energy to perform useful tasks. It integrates foundational research, applied engineering, and operational techniques to produce technical objects and user-facing products.

## Formulation

> **How to characterize this technology?** Electronics technology can be characterized as a layered system of knowledge, methods, and artifacts that transform electrical energy into useful functions. Its characterization involves understanding the relationships among foundational research, technical research, operational techniques, technical objects, and the products they enable.

## Terminology

> Note: Technical objects are constructed from combinations of other technical objects and the operational techniques that underpin them.

> Note: A Product is also a Technical Object—one that aggregates multiple technical objects and operational techniques into a deployable, externally oriented system. However, in this document we will use the term Product specifically to refer to the final user–facing object.

> Note: There are other types of techniques for specialized industries. In computing, **Representational Techniques** are particularly important, as they define how information, processes, or states are encoded, modeled, or depicted for processing, storage, and communication.
