# Energy Technology

> Energy technology encompasses the study, development, and application of methods, systems, and devices to generate, convert, store, transmit, and efficiently use energy. It integrates physics, materials science, chemical processes, mechanical systems, electrical systems, and computational control to deliver usable energy for industrial, commercial, and residential purposes.

## Terminology

> Note: Technical objects are constructed from combinations of other technical objects and the operational techniques that underpin them.

> Note: A Product is also a Technical Object—one that aggregates multiple technical objects and operational techniques into a deployable, externally oriented system. However, in this document we will use the term Product specifically to refer to the final user–facing object.

> Note: There are other types of techniques for specialized industries. In computing, **Representational Techniques** are particularly important, as they define how information, processes, or states are encoded, modeled, or depicted for processing, storage, and communication.

> Note: Technical Objects can be components or objects used in the production process.
