# Stock Market

> The **stock market** is a financial marketplace where buyers and sellers trade stocks, representing ownership in companies, and where the prices of these securities are determined by supply and demand dynamics.

> A **stock** (or **equity security**) is a **fungible financial instrument** that represents a **proportional ownership claim** on the **residual net assets and earnings** of a corporation, as defined in its corporate charter.

> Note: The definition of a stock is very technical; every word is relevant.

## Stock

Let's parse the definition step by step to make each component clear:

---

### 📘 Original Definition:

> A **stock** (or **equity security**) is a **fungible financial instrument** that represents a **proportional ownership claim** on the **residual net assets and earnings** of a corporation, as defined in its corporate charter.

---

## 🧠 Parsed Breakdown:

### 🔹 **Stock (or equity security)**

* These are synonyms in this context.
* They refer to a type of **ownership instrument** issued by a corporation.

---

### 🔹 **Fungible financial instrument**

* **Fungible**: Interchangeable; one share of the same class is equal to any other.
* **Financial instrument**: A legal contract that holds monetary value — like stocks, bonds, derivatives.

> ✅ Translation: A stock is a tradeable, standardized asset that represents financial value.

---

### 🔹 **Proportional ownership claim**

* You **own a share of the corporation**, not specific physical assets.
* Your share is **proportional** to the number of shares you hold compared to the total.

> ✅ Example: Own 100 shares of a company with 10,000 shares = 1% ownership.

---

### 🔹 **Residual net assets and earnings**

* **Residual** = what’s left after debts and obligations.
* **Net assets** = total assets – liabilities.
* **Earnings** = profits after expenses.

> ✅ You only have a claim on the leftovers, **after creditors and other stakeholders** are paid.

---

### 🔹 **As defined in its corporate charter**

* The **corporate charter** (or articles of incorporation) specifies:

  * Classes of stock
  * Rights (e.g., voting, dividends)
  * How earnings and assets are distributed

> ✅ This limits or defines your rights as a shareholder. You're not entitled to anything beyond what's outlined there.

---

## ✅ Complete Rephrased Version (Plain Language)

> A stock is a standardized, tradeable ownership unit in a corporation that gives its holder a proportionate claim — defined by the company’s rules — on whatever is left over (assets and profits) **after** all other obligations have been met.

## Types of Stocks

There are several **types of stocks**, classified by **rights, structure, and market behavior**. Here's a detailed breakdown:

## 🧾 1. **By Class of Rights**

### 🟦 **Common Stock** (Ordinary Shares)

* **Voting rights**: Usually 1 vote per share
* **Dividends**: Variable, not guaranteed
* **Residual claim**: Last in line in liquidation
* Most publicly traded shares are common stock

### 🟨 **Preferred Stock**

* **No or limited voting rights**
* **Fixed dividends** (like a bond)
* **Priority over common stock** in liquidation
* Can be **convertible**, **callable**, or **participating**

## 🧾 2. **By Share Class (Within a Type)**

Companies may issue **multiple classes of stock** with different rights:

### 🟧 **Class A / B / C shares** (naming is arbitrary)

* May differ in:

  * **Voting power** (e.g., 1 vote vs. 10 votes)
  * **Dividend structure**
  * **Transferability**
* Used by founders to **retain control** while going public

Example: Google (Alphabet) has:

* **Class A (GOOGL)** – 1 vote
* **Class B** – 10 votes (held by insiders)
* **Class C (GOOG)** – no votes

## 📈 3. **By Market Behavior**

### 🔵 **Growth Stocks**

* Reinvest profits, little or no dividends
* High earnings growth potential
* Often overvalued by traditional metrics
* Example: Tech startups

### 🟢 **Value Stocks**

* Undervalued based on fundamentals (low P/E, P/B)
* Often pay dividends
* Example: Established firms in mature industries

### 🟠 **Income Stocks**

* High dividend payouts
* Low growth
* Attracts income-focused investors
* Example: Utilities

### 🔴 **Cyclical Stocks**

* Performance tied to economic cycles (e.g., automotive, travel)
* Do well in booms, poorly in recessions

### ⚪ **Defensive Stocks**

* Stable earnings in all conditions
* Often in essential industries (healthcare, food)
* Less volatile

---

## 🧾 4. **Other Specialized Types**

### 📍 **Penny Stocks**

* Trade at very low prices (usually <\$5)
* Small-cap, highly speculative

### 📍 **ESOP Shares** (Employee Stock Ownership Plan)

* Allocated to employees as compensation
* Usually with vesting schedules

### 📍 **ADR (American Depositary Receipt)**

* Foreign company stocks traded on U.S. exchanges

### 📍 **Tracking Stocks**

* Tied to a division or business unit of a parent company
* Not ownership of the whole firm

## How `owns`  a public companpy then?


Excellent question.

---

## 🏛️ **Who Owns a Company?**

### In **corporate legal theory**, ownership is divided into **claims** and **control rights**, and the answer depends on **how you define "ownership."**

---

### ✅ **Common Shareholders Are the Residual Owners**

* They **legally own** the corporation **in a residual sense**.
* This means:

  * They **hold the equity**.
  * They have a **claim on what's left** after everyone else is paid (debts, wages, taxes, preferred stock).
  * They **elect the board of directors**, who supervise management.

But...

> ⚠️ **They do not "own" the company like you own a bicycle.**

* They don’t own the assets directly.
* They can’t direct daily operations.
* Their rights are defined by the corporate charter and law.

---

### 📊 **Control is Executed By:**

| Group                      | Function                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Board of Directors**     | Strategic oversight, hired by shareholders                       |
| **Executive Management**   | Day-to-day control (CEO, CFO, etc.)                              |
| **Creditors** (indirectly) | Can seize assets or trigger bankruptcy if covenants are breached |
| **Regulators**             | Define the legal boundaries of what the company can do           |

---

### 🧾 Legal Framework Summary:

* **The corporation is a separate legal entity**.
* No one "owns" it the way you own private property.
* Shareholders own **shares**, which give them **defined legal rights** over that entity.

---

### 🧠 Analogy:

Think of a company as a **container**:

* Shareholders own **shares in the container**.
* They don’t own the contents directly (like trucks, buildings, IP).
* The container follows a rulebook (charter, law).
* Management operates it, and courts/board ensure accountability.
