South Korea offers various export incentives and support schemes to promote its exports and enhance the competitiveness of Korean companies in the global market. Some of the key export incentives schemes in South Korea include:

1. **Export Credit and Financing Programs:** South Korean export credit agencies, such as the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (K-Sure) and the Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM), provide export credit and financing facilities to support Korean exporters. These programs offer credit insurance, guarantees, and loans to mitigate commercial and political risks associated with exporting.
2. **Export Promotion Funds:** The South Korean government provides export promotion funds to support export-oriented activities, including market research, product development, overseas marketing, and participation in international trade fairs and exhibitions. These funds help Korean companies expand their presence in international markets and explore new export opportunities.
3. **Customs Duty Exemption and Drawback:** Certain export-oriented industries in South Korea may benefit from customs duty exemption or drawback programs, which allow exporters to reclaim or waive customs duties paid on imported raw materials, components, or equipment used in the production of export goods. This reduces production costs and enhances export competitiveness.
4. **Tax Incentives:** South Korea offers various tax incentives to encourage exports and investment in export-oriented industries. These incentives may include reduced corporate income tax rates, tax credits for export-related expenses, and tax exemptions for certain export earnings or profits derived from overseas operations.
5. **Free Trade Agreements (FTAs):** South Korea has entered into several free trade agreements with other countries and regions, which provide preferential trade treatment and tariff concessions for Korean exporters. By leveraging FTAs, Korean companies can access new markets, reduce trade barriers, and enhance their competitiveness in international trade.
6. **Export Subsidies and Grants:** The South Korean government provides export subsidies and grants to support specific export sectors or activities deemed strategic or priority areas. These subsidies may include direct financial assistance, grants for export-related investments, and subsidies for export-oriented research and development (R&D) projects.
7. **Export Marketing Assistance:** South Korea offers export marketing assistance programs to help Korean companies promote their products and services in international markets. These programs may include export marketing seminars, trade missions, buyer-seller matchmaking events, and export counseling services provided by government agencies such as the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA).

These export incentives and support schemes aim to facilitate South Korea's export-led growth strategy, boost export competitiveness, and drive economic development by promoting international trade and investment.
