## Business Model (Value Capture)

### Revenue Architecture

- **Revenue Streams**:  
  - ~85% recurring subscription (annual contracts)  
  - ~15% implementation, advisory, and transaction fees  
  - Segmented by client size & geography

- **Pricing Architecture**:  
  - **Tiered subscription** (per employee per month – PEPM)  
  - **Bundling**: Payroll + HR + Benefits = higher ARPU  
  - **Volume discounts** for large clients

- **Elasticity**:  
  - **Inelastic demand** (payroll is mission-critical)  
  - Enterprise clients: low elasticity; SMBs: moderate sensitivity

- **Volume Model**:  
  - **Recurring**: >90% of revenue  
  - **Installed base**: 1M+ clients, 86M+ workers on platform  
  - High **utilization** (clients use multiple modules)

- **Contractual Mechanisms**:  
  - 1–3 year contracts with auto-renewal  
  - High **switching costs** (data migration, compliance risk)  
  - **Lock-in** via ecosystem (ADP Marketplace integrations)

### Unit Economics & Margins

- **Contribution Margin**:  
  - SMB: Lower ARPU but high scalability → strong margins at scale  
  - Enterprise: Higher ARPU, higher service cost → still >60% gross margin  
  - Global: Lower margins initially, improves with scale

- **Cost Behavior**:  
  - **Fixed**: Platform dev, compliance research  
  - **Variable**: Payment processing fees, cloud compute  
  - **Step-fixed**: Regional support, tax specialists

- **Marginal Cost Curve**:  
  - **Downward sloping** due to automation and network effects  
  - Near-zero marginal cost for additional SMB clients

- **Learning Curves**:  
  - Continuous improvement in automation → reduced manual review  
  - AI reduces exception handling over time

- **Margin Sensitivity**:  
  - Low sensitivity to labor costs (automation-heavy)  
  - Moderate sensitivity to cloud/compute costs  
  - High resilience to demand shocks

### Cost Structure & Operating Leverage

- **Operating Leverage**: High (70%+ gross margin, ~30% EBITDA margin)  
- **Break-even**: Achieved at ~300K SMB clients (well surpassed)  
- **Robustness**: Recession-resistant; compliance needs persist  
- **Bottlenecks**: Talent in AI/compliance; international regulatory complexity

### Capital Structure Interaction

- **Debt Ratio**: Moderate leverage (investment-grade balance sheet)  
- **FCF Generation**: >$2B annually; supports dividends + buybacks  
- **Value Capture**: Primarily **operational** (not financial engineering)

### Market Power & Competitive Position

- **Value Capture Mechanism**:  
  - **Differentiation** (compliance depth, global reach)  
  - **Switching costs** (data, compliance risk)  
  - **Network effects** in ecosystem (ADP Marketplace)

- **Markup**: 3–5x over marginal cost in SMB segment  
- **Bargaining Power**:  
  - **High vs. SMB clients**  
  - **Moderate vs. enterprise** (more negotiation)  
  - **High vs. suppliers** (scale advantage)

- **Barriers to Entry**:  
  - Regulatory complexity  
  - Trust & brand (50+ years)  
  - Data network (86M+ worker profiles)

### Contractual, Platform, and Data-Based Capture

- **Platform Fees**: Ecosystem partners pay for integration  
- **Data Monetization**: **Not sold**; used internally for benchmarking (ADP DataCloud)  
- **Lock-in**: Deep integrations with accounting/ERP systems

### Risk Structure & Value Retention

- **Key Risks**:  
  - Regulatory missteps (fines, reputational)  
  - Cybersecurity breaches  
  - Disruption by verticalized AI-native entrants

- **Value Retention Mechanisms**:  
  - Long-term contracts  
  - Proactive compliance updates  
  - Redundant infrastructure  
  - Client success teams

- **Cashflow Variance**:  
  - >85% stable, recurring  
  - <15% project-based (low volatility)

## Miscellaneous

### Resource Allocation (Internal Economics)

- **Capital Allocation**: Balanced between R&D (~4% of revenue), M&A (tuck-ins), dividends  
- **Labor Allocation**: Engineering, compliance, client success  
- **Coordination**: Hybrid (centralized platform + regional compliance teams)

### Incentives & Governance

- **Agency Alignment**: Strong (long-term CEO tenure, equity incentives)  
- **Ownership**: Widely held (no controlling shareholder)  
- **Monitoring**: Robust audit, SOX compliance

### Dynamics & Growth

- **Capability Development**: AI/ML, global payroll, analytics  
- **Innovation Routines**: Continuous delivery + regulatory sandboxing  
- **Learning Curves**: Decades of payroll data → predictive accuracy  
- **Path Dependence**: Legacy trust in payroll → expansion into HCM
