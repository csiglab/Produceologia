# Short

> A class of investment strategies in which an investor profits from the decline in the price of an asset. This is typically achieved by borrowing the asset, selling it at the current market price, and later buying it back at a lower price to return it to the lenderâ€”capturing the difference as profit.

> Short positions are common in hedging, speculation, and pair trading, but they carry unlimited risk if the asset price rises significantly.
