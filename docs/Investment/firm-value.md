- Market Cap + Deb - Cash (we take out the cash  that they have; because it's not a cost)

`EV=Market Capitalization+Total Debt−Cash and Cash Equivalents`


| Component  | Why It's Treated That Way in EV |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Debt**   | You assume it — adds to cost    |
| **Cash**   | You keep it — lowers net cost   |
| **Equity** | You pay it — part of cost       |
